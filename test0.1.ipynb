CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM  \\n \\n1.1.1. \\nIntroduction \\nCardiovascular system comprises of the  heart and an extensively branched \\nstructure of blood vessels that transports oxygen, nutrients , heat, and other \\n substances throughout the body. \\nCardiac or heart muscles are involuntary striated muscles found in the heart and  \\nits walls, especially in the myocardium (the muscle tissue forming\\n a thick \\nmiddle layer amid the outer epicardium and the inner endocardium\\n). For \\ndelivering oxygen and nutr ients, and removing waste products such as carbon \\ndioxide, the cardiac muscle  cells depend on the available blood and e\\nlectrical \\n supply.  \\nThe myocardial tissue  is made up of contracting cells  and conducting cells . \\nThe pumping action of the heart involves \\nthe contracting cells. \\nThe \\nconducting tissues of the heart include SA node (acts as the pacemaker), AV \\nnode, and His -Purkinje system. Various parts of the conducting tissue \\nexhibit \\nautomaticity.  Cardiac muscles  being specialised tissues have distinct \\nproperties of: \\n1) Excitability: It is the ability of cardiac cells to depolarise in response to a \\nstimulus. \\n2) Contractility: It is the ability of myocardium to contract and pump blood out \\nof the heart. \\n3) Automaticity: It is the ability of cardiac cells to generate electrical impulses \\nspontaneously.  \\n \\n1.1.2. \\nHemodynamics \\nThe study of the dynamic behaviour of blood\\n is termed hemodynamics. \\nPressures are generated in the various parts of heart (cardiovascular pressures) \\nwhen blood flows from one chamber to another, when valves open and close, and \\nwhen the myocardium contracts and relaxes. Catheters are used to measure and \\nmonitor these pressures by placing their tips in the atria, pulmonary artery\\n, or \\n systemic arteries; these are called the hemodynamic lines. \\nHemodynamic lines have multiple uses: \\n1) They allow the sampling of venous and arterial blood without having to stick \\na patient frequently. \\n2) They help in monitoring different  waveforms, thus  providing evidences to \\npatient’s status. \\nCHAPTER \\n1 \\n \\n \\nPharmacology of Drugs \\nActing on CVS \\n', 'link': []}, 16: {'text': '16 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n3) The cardiac output can be calculated \\nwith the combination of pulmonary, \\narterial, and systemic arterial lines. \\n4) They allow direct  monitoring of various cardiac pressures, and a nalysis of \\nthese pressures helps in planning and \\nassessing therapy in shock, cardiac \\nfailure, fluid overload or deficit, and other conditions. \\n \\n1.1.3. \\nElectrophysiology of Heart \\nThe cardiac cell is a polarised membrane . It has a  resting membrane potential of \\n–80 to –90mV, and a high Na+ ion concentration outside the membrane and K + \\nion concentration inside the membrane. Upon excitation, depolarisation occurs as \\nthe cell membrane permeability to Na + ions increases, the negativity of resting \\npotential is lost,  and a positive \\ncurrent is gen erated inside the cell. The \\ncharacteristics of action potential \\nrely on the type of the cell\\n-myocardial \\ncontractile cell, or pacemaker, or potential pacemaker cell. There are five phases \\nof the action potential of cardiac cells (figure 1.1): \\n1) Phase 0:  In t his phase,  rapid \\ndepolarisation of the cell membrane \\nis observed  as the sodium ions \\nrapidly enter the cell through sodium \\nchannels. This phase  is followed by \\nre-polarisation.  \\n2) Phase 1:  In this short and initial \\nphase, rapid re-polarisation is \\nobserved as the potassium ions move \\nout of the cell. \\n3) Phase 2:  This prolonged plateau \\nphase is observed as the calcium \\nions enter the cell slowly through the \\ncalcium channels . This phase of \\naction potential is present only in the \\ncardiac cells. \\n4) Phase 3: This phase is th e second period of rapid re -polarisation as the \\npotassium ions move out of the cell. \\n5) Phase 4: This is the resting phase as the resting membrane potential is re -\\nestablished when the potassium ions return into the cell and sodium and \\ncalcium ions move out of it.  \\n \\nThe cells do not depolarise in response to another impulse during the phases 1 \\nand 2; and this is called the absolute refractory period. The cells depolarise in \\nresponse to a powerful impulse d uring the phases 3 and 4; and this is called the \\n relative refractory period. \\nThe heart rate and stroke volume are used for determining the cardiac output. The \\nstroke volume depends on the preload  (which itself depends on venous return) , \\nafterload, and contractility. The load on the heart due to the \\nblood volume \\nreaching the left ventricle is called \\npreload; while  the resistance to the left \\nventricular ejection, i.e., the total peripheral resistance is called afterload. \\n–100 \\n–90 \\n–80 \\n–70 \\n–60 \\n–50 \\n–40 \\n–30 \\n–20 \\n–10 \\n0 \\n+10 \\n+20 \\n4 \\n0 \\n3 \\nERP \\n1 \\n2 \\nFigure 1.1: Phases of Cardiac Action Potential.  \\nPhase 0 Indicates Rapid Depolarisation, Phases \\n1-3 Indicate Repolarisation, Phase 4 Indicates \\nGradual Depolarisation during Diastole. \\n', 'link': []}, 17: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n17 \\n*  \\n* \\n1.2. DRUGS USED IN CONGESTIVE HEART \\nFAILURE \\n \\n1.2.1. \\nIntroduction \\nWhen a heart fails to pump blood in a quantity sufficient to fulfil the body \\nrequirements, a condition of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) occurs, which is \\nalso known as a Heart Failure (HF). \\n \\nCHF is caused due to: \\n1) Narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscles, \\n2) Any congenital heart defects, \\n3) Endocarditis (infection in heart valves) or myocarditis (infection of heart \\nmuscles),  \\n4) Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscles),  \\n5) Any long -term heart valve disease (due to past rheumatic fever \\nor other \\ncauses) and high blood pressure, and \\n6) Past history of the  patient who has suffered from myocardial infarction or \\nheart attack and the injured tissue obstructs the normal functioning of heart. \\n \\nSome common symptoms of CHF are: \\n1) Fatigue, \\n2) Swelling or oedema,  \\n3) Shortness of breath, and \\n4) Increased urination.  \\n \\n1.2.2. \\n Classification  \\nThe following drugs are employed in the treatment of CHF: \\n1) Drugs with Positive Inotropic Effects \\ni) Cardiac Glycosides: Digoxin, Digitoxin, and Ouabain. \\nii) Bipyridines/Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Amrinone and Milrinone. \\niii) β-Adrenergic Agonists: Dobutamine and Dopamine. \\n2) Drugs without Positive Inotropic Effects \\ni) Diuretics: Thiazides, Furosemide, and Spironolactone. \\nii) Angiotensin Antagonists: ACE inhibitors and Losartan. \\niii) β-Adrenergic Antagonists: Bisoprolol, Carvedilol, and Metoprolol. \\niv) Vasodilators: Nitrates and Hydralazine. \\n \\n1.2.3. \\nCardiac Glycosides \\nCardiac glycosides are derived from plant derivatives and are steroidal in nature. \\nA glycoside is a sugar-containing compound in which one of the hydroxyl groups \\n of the sugar molecule is replaced with another compound.  \\nDigoxin, digitoxin, and ouabain are the commonly used cardiac glycosides. \\nOften, the term digitalis refers to the complete group of cardiac glycosides as all \\nthe drugs in this group exert the same effects on the heart. They differ only in \\nlipid solubility, rapidity, degree of absorption, protein binding, metabolic \\npathway, and excretion. \\n', 'link': []}, 18: {'text': '18 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n1.2.3.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe mechanism of action of digitalis can be explained as follows (figure 1.2): \\n1) Digitalis exerts a positive inotropic effect due to its ability \\nto potentiate the \\nexcitation-contraction coupling. This is possible since digitalis increases the \\nconcentration of free intracellular Ca2+ ions.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2) It inhibits the membrane bound Na\\n+/K+-ATPase transport system (sodium \\npump), resulting in increase of intracellular Na + ions and loss of intracellular \\nK+ ions.   \\n3) As Na+ ions accumulate inside the cell, it activates a Na +/Ca2+ carrier system \\n(a non -enzymatic protein carrier) within the membrane. The activation of \\nNa+/Ca2+carrier system results in an increase in the influx of Ca 2+ ions. Three \\nNa+ ions are exchanged for each Ca2+ ion, thereby generating an electrogenic \\npotential by this exchanger.  \\n4) Normally, the concentration of Ca2+ ions around the myofilaments is lowered by \\nthe Ca2+ ion pump in the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR). The energy for driving \\nthis pump is obtained by ATP hydrolysis carried out by Na\\n+/K+-ATPase. \\nHowever, digitalis inhibits this enzyme and hence less energy is available for \\ndriving the Ca2+ ion pump. Thus, the supply of Ca2+ ions from SR around the \\nmyofilaments increases, which in turn activates the contractile machinery.\\n \\n5) The binding of digitalis to sodium pump is inhibited by the K+ ions present in \\nthe serum. Hence, conditions of hypokalaemia facilitate the action of \\ndigitalis. On the other hand, conditions of hyperkalaemia can decrea\\nse \\ncardiac toxicity. Arrhythmia induced by digitalis, is increased by co nditions \\nof hypercalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia.  \\n \\n1.2.3.2. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nRoute of administration of digitalis is either \\noral or intravenous. It is not \\nsuitable for administration by subcutaneous or intramuscular routes as its \\nabsorption from these sites is not re liable and may bring about local irritation, \\ntenderness, swelling, and abscess.  \\nFigure 1.2: Cellular Mechanism of Digitalis Action. \\na) Tendency of Na+ to flow in and K+ to flow out along the concentration \\ngradient; b) Na+/K+-ATPase pushing the Na+ out and drawing the K+ in;  \\nc) Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism; d) Release of  Ca2+ from Sarcoplasmic \\nReticulum (SR); e) Ca2+ + troponin initiating myocardial contraction. \\ne \\nd \\nc \\nb \\na \\nMyocardial contraction \\nCa + Troponin \\nActin + Myosin \\nActomyosin \\nMyocardial cell \\nCa2+ SR \\nNa+ \\nNa+ \\nCa2+ \\nexchange \\nK+ \\nNa+- K+- \\nATPase \\nNa+ \\nK+ \\nNa+ \\nCa2+ \\n* \\n* Digitalis acts on the enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase \\n', 'link': []}, 19: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n19 \\n*  \\n* \\nDigitalis does not bind selectively to the myocardium when administered through \\nthese sites. Digitalis is a cumulative drug. It has a \\nprolonged half-life and the \\nduration of its action ranges from days to weeks . The prolonged plasma half -\\nlife of digitoxin is due to its enterohepatic circulation. \\n \\n1.2.3.3. \\nPharmacological Actions \\nCardiac glycosides have the capability of increasing the myocardial contraction\\n force, \\nwhich is the most sig nificant property of these drugs. Other than this, they have \\nseveral extra-cardiac effects on vascular smooth muscle\\ns, kidneys, gut and the CNS:  \\n1) Actions on Heart \\ni) Administration in small doses causes an increase in the vagal tone  by \\nsensitisation of baroreceptors and/or activity of the afferent nerves. As a \\nresult, sinus activity decreases which le ads to decrease in conductivity, \\nprolongation of refractory period of the AV node, decre\\nase in atrial \\nrefractory period, and bradycardia. \\nii) Contractility of the myo\\ncardium increases  by a direct \\npositive \\ninotropic action of digitalis on the heart. Thus, the failing heart contracts \\neven more forcefully, which results in increased cardiac output, complete \\nventricular emptying, and decreased diastolic pressure  and ventricular \\nsize. Systole lasts for a shorter duration, giving more time for ventricular \\nfilling and rest to the heart. \\niii) With the increase in contractility of heart, the oxygen consumption in the \\nmyocardium increases. On the other hand, decrease in the heart rate  and \\nventricular size decreases oxygen requirements of the heart. Hence, the \\ngeneral effect of digitalis is an improved ventricular performance of \\nthe failing heart without any significant increase in energy requirement.  \\niv) When administered in comparatively  small therapeutic doses, digitalis \\nimproves the ability of excitation of the myocardium\\n and the \\nconduction velocity. However, its administration in high doses causes an \\nincreased automaticity and decreases the refractory period of the atria \\nand the ventri cles, resulting in extra\\n-systoles, pulsus bigeminus , and \\nventricular fibrillation. \\nv) Digitalis slows the conduction velocity in the AV node and His-Purkinje \\nsystem, regardless of the dose administered. This is achieved by an \\nincrease in the refractory period  by both vagal as well as the extra -vagal \\nactions of digitalis. Low doses are characterised by a predominance of \\nvagal effects. As the dose is increased, direct depressant action on the \\nAV node is seen. \\nvi) Digitalis does not act directly to influence the \\ncoronary flow. The \\nenhanced coronary circulation is a secondary effect of the increased \\ncardiac output and extended diastole. \\nvii) Changes evident in an ECG  after administration of digitalis includes \\nprolongation of the PR interval\\n (due to delayed conduction) and \\nshortening of QT interval  (shorter ventricular systole). Other changes \\nare that the ST segment sags below the isoelectric line, and the T-wave \\nappear smaller, inverted or disappears. \\n', 'link': []}, 20: {'text': '20 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Extra-Cardiac Effects of Digitalis \\ni) On Blood Vessels: Digitalis exerts a minor direct constrictor action on \\nthe smooth muscles of arteries and veins. \\nii) On Kidneys: Digitalis improves circulation and decreases sympathetic \\nactivity, thereby increasing the blood flow to kidneys. This increases the \\nurinary output and relieves oedema in patients with cardiac oedema. \\niii) On Gastrointestinal Tract: Digitalis stimulates the Chemoreceptor \\nTrigger Zone (CTZ) in the medulla, thus resulting in nausea and vomiting.\\n \\niv) On CNS: Digitalis may produce symptoms of visual disturbances such \\nas blurring of vi sion, photophobia, a dark spot in centre of vision\\n, and \\ndisturbances of coloured vision with yellow and green. In some patients, \\npsychic symptoms and confusion may also be seen. \\n \\n1.2.3.4. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nCardiac glycosides have the following therapeutic benefits: \\n1) Patients with congestive heart failure characterised by a dilated, failing heart \\nwith low  cardiac output (impaired systolic function) are benefited by \\nadministration of digitalis.  \\n2) Treatment of low output cardiac failure with digitalis, in patients where t\\nhe \\nmyocardium is not principally damaged, shows the best results. Examples of \\nsuch conditions include atrial fibrillation, valvular defects, and hypertension.  \\n3) The management of cardiac arrhythmias (supraventricular tachyarrhythmias), \\nlike atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, occurring either with or without CCF, \\nemploys the use of digitalis.  \\n \\n1.2.3.5. \\nAdverse Effects \\nDigitalis is highly toxic. It has a low margin of safety with a therapeutic index \\nranging from 1.5 -3. Patients with stead y-state plasma digoxin le vels report a \\nhigher cardiac mortality during maintenance therapy. Nearly 25% of the patients \\nshow either of the toxic symptoms, which include: \\n1) Extra-Cardiac Effects: These adverse effects are seen initially  and include \\nanorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdo minal pain. These effects appear due to \\ngastric irritation, mesenteric vasoconstriction, and \\nCTZ stimulation. The \\nother adverse effects include fatigue, absence of a desire to walk or lift an \\narm, malaise, headache, mental confusion, restlessness, hyperpno\\nea, \\ndisorientation, psychosis, and visual disturbances . Rare adverse effects \\ninclude diarrhoea, skin rashes, and gynaecomastia. \\n2) Cardiac Effects: Digitalis produces  almost every type of arrhythmia, \\nincluding pulsus bigeminus, nodal and ventricular extrasyst oles, ventricular \\ntachycardia, and terminally fibrillation. \\n \\n1.2.3.6. \\nDrug Interactions \\nCardiac glycosides undergo the following drug interactions: \\n1) Administration of digitalis with a diuretic results in hypokalaemia, which \\ncan precipitate digitalis arrhythmias.  \\n', 'link': []}, 21: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n21 \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Administration of digitalis with calcium synergises the actions of digitalis, \\nthereby precipitating toxicity. \\n3) Quinidine decreases the binding of digoxin to tissue proteins.  \\n4) Administration of digitalis with adrenergic drugs induces arrhythmias and \\nincreases ectopic automaticity. \\n5) Metoclopramide \\n(gastrointestinal hurrying), \\nsucralfate, \\nneomycin, \\nsulphasalazine, and antacids decrease the absorption of digoxin by adsorbing it.  \\n6) Atropinic drugs including tricyclic antidepressants increase the absorption \\nof digoxin by delaying its gastric emptying. \\n7) Erythromycin, omeprazole, and tetracycline increase the bioavailability of \\ndigoxin. \\n8) Propranolol, verapamil, diltiazem, and disopyramide oppose the positive \\ninotropic action of digitalis and may add to the depression of A-V conduction.  \\n9) Phenobarbitone accelerates the m etabolism of digitoxin , thus, reducing its \\nplasma half-life.  \\n10) Administration of succinylcholine by the patients on digitalis therapy causes \\narrhythmias. \\n \\n1.2.3.7. \\nContraindications \\nCardiac glycosides are contraindicated in the following conditions: \\n1) Digitalis is contraindicated in hypokalaemia as its binding to Na+K+-ATPase \\nis increased, thus increasing digitalis toxicity. \\n2) It is contraindicated in elderly and in patients having severe renal or hepatic \\ndisease. \\n3) It is con traindicated in myocardial infarction as s evere arrhythmias may \\ndevelop.  \\n4) It is contraindicated in \\nthyrotoxicosis as the patient’s responsiveness \\ndecreases, and arrhythmias may also develop. \\n5) It is contraindicated in \\nventricular tachycardia as it may precip\\nitate \\nventricular fibrillation. \\n6) It is contraindicated in Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome as it may result \\nin ventricular failure.  \\n7) Administration of digitalis in patients with a partial A-V block may convert \\nit into a complete A-V block. \\n8) Digoxin is contrain dicated in myxoedema as its elimination rate decreases, \\nthus, cumulative toxicity of digitalis may be seen. \\n \\n1.2.3.8. \\nTreatment of Digitalis Toxicity \\nThe cases of digitalis toxicity can be treated in the following ways: \\n1) Withdrawal: Administration of digitalis should either be stopped or the dose \\nshould be reduced based on  the severity of toxicity. \\nUse of potassium \\ndepleting diuretics should be discontinued. \\n2) Potassium Repletion: KCl is administered by oral route (or by slow IV drip) \\nin a dosage of 2gm in every 4 hour s. During this time, ECG of the patient \\nshould be continuously monitored. However, in case of a severe AV block, \\nKCl should not be given. \\n', 'link': []}, 22: {'text': '22 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n3) Antiarrhythmic Drugs: Ventricular tachyarrhythmias can be suppressed by \\nphenytoin and lignocaine since they have eith\\ner little or no effect on \\nconduction. Phenytoin is administered in a dose of  100mg via IV infusion in \\nevery 5 minutes till arrhythmia is treated.  \\n \\nSupraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, without AV block, can be \\ntreated by administering propranolol in dosages of 20-80mg/day. \\n \\nSinus bradycardia and various degrees of AV block can be controlled \\nwith \\natropine. \\n4) Advanced Cases of Life Threatening Digitalis Intoxication: Such conditions \\ncan be reversed by inserting a temporary cardiac pacemaker catheter, a\\nlong with \\npurified digoxin-specific antibody (digitalis immune fab) fragments.\\n \\n \\n1.2.4. \\nBipyridines \\nBipyridine derivatives ( e.g., amrinone and milrinone) show phosphodieste rase \\n(PDE) inhibiting activity. These drugs are selective inhibitors of PDE-isoenzyme \\nIII, found in the cardiac and smooth muscles.  \\n \\n1.2.4.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nBipyridines increase the production of cAMP in the heart and blood vessels , and \\nthus exert a positive inotropic action along with vas odilator activities. Increased \\nlevels of intracellular cAMP enable the availability of more intracellular Ca\\n2+ \\nions, thus, a more positive inotropism may result. \\n \\n1.2.4.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nCardiac output is increased. The peripheral vascular resistance and the after-load \\nare decreased with no significant change in heart rate and blood pressure. \\nBipyridines are used only for the treatment of heart failure or exacerbation of CCF. \\n \\n1.2.4.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nGiven below are the adverse effects of bipyridine derivatives: \\n1) Amrinone causes nausea, vomiting, liver enzyme changes, and occasionally \\nthrombocytopenia. \\n2) Milrinone may cause cardiac arrhythmia, bone marrow depression, and liver \\ntoxicity.  \\n \\nDue to these adverse effects, these agents are used for short-term therapy only. \\n \\n1.2.5. \\nβ-Adrenergic Agonists \\nThe discovery of  \\uf0621-agonists has sufficed the search for a positive inotropic \\n\\uf062-\\nagonist with minimal positive chronotropic and arrhythmogenic potential, with \\ndobutamine being the most potential one amongst these agents.  \\n \\n1.2.5.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe β-adrenergic agonists increase the cardiac output, and \\ndecrease the \\nventricular filling pressure and pre-load. Some degree of tachycardia is also seen \\nwith the use of these drugs. They increase the consumption of oxygen.  \\n', 'link': []}, 23: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n23 \\n*  \\n* \\n1.2.5.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe β-adrenergic agonists have been limited to the management of acute heart \\nfailure. They may occasionally be employed in the treatment of refractory \\nCCF. \\n \\n1.2.5.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe β-adrenergic agonists may cause tachyphylaxis.  \\n \\n1.2.6. \\nDiuretics \\nDiuretics are commonly used in the management of CHF. Since the last 50 years, \\nthese agents are favoured for CHF treatment.  \\n \\n1.2.6.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nDiuretics increase the excretion of salt and water. This in turn decreases the \\nventricular pre -load and the cardiac size, improves pump function\\n, and helps \\nrelieve oedema. In CHF patients, aldosterone promotes fibrosis in the heart and \\nblood vessels. This effect of \\naldosterone is antagonised by spironolactone (an \\naldosterone antagonist). \\n \\n1.2.6.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nDiuretics are used in the management of all stages of CHF. Furosemide is a very \\nefficient diuretic in treating acute left ventricular failure (cardiac asthma). \\n \\n1.2.6.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe adverse effects of various classes of diuretics are: \\n1) Loop Diuretics: Hypokalaemia is a common adverse effect. Patients \\non \\nlong-term diuretics require potassium supplements and regular \\nmonitoring. At high \\ndoses, hyponatraemia may \\noccur, whi ch needs \\ncareful supervision in heart failure patients. \\nOtotoxicity characterised \\nwith tinnitus, vertigo and deafness also occurs at high doses of loop \\ndiuretics.  Therefore, intravenous administration of \\nfurosemide should not \\nbe faster than 4mg/min.  \\n2) Thiazide Diuretics: Due to potassium and sodium loss, the adverse effects \\nof thiazide diuretics are similar to \\nthose of loop diuretics.  However, the \\npotassium loss is \\nreduced when ACE inhibitors are \\nsimultaneously \\nprescribed. Diabetic patients  need monitoring as  diabetes may  occur with \\nthiazide diuretics. Impotence as well as sensitivity may also develop due to \\nthe presence of sulphonamide in the drugs. \\n3) Aldosterone Antagonists : Adverse effects include fibrosis, hypertrophy , \\narrhythmogenesis,  and hyperkalaemia, wh ich require regular monitoring \\nbecause of its potentially lethal effects in CHF patients \\ndue to renal \\nfailure.  \\n \\nHyponatraemia and  feminisation such as gynaecomastia are other adverse \\neffects. In patients \\nhaving severe symptomatic systolic heart failure, \\nspironolactone is recommended along with ACE inhibitors.  \\n', 'link': []}, 24: {'text': '24 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n1.2.7. \\nAngiotensin Antagonists \\n The ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are included in this group. \\n1.2.7.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nDrugs which inhibit the activity of RAS either interfere with the biosynthesis of \\nangiotensin II [Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors], or act as \\n antagonists of angiotensin receptors [Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)]. \\nThe production of an\\ngiotensin II from angiotensin I is inhibited by ACE \\ninhibitors. These agents neutralise the raised peripheral vascular resistance and \\nretention of sodium and water that resulted from angiotensin II and aldosterone.  \\n \\n1.2.7.2. \\nPharmacological Actions \\nThe pharmacological actions of angiotensin antagonists are: \\n1) Reduction in peripheral arterial resistance and after-load. \\n2) Reduction in aldosterone secretion, thus decreasing the retention of salt and \\nwater. This causes venodilatation and reduces pre-load. \\n3) Reduction in \\nangiotensin concentration in the tissues, thus reducing \\nangiotensin-induced tissue norepinephrine release. \\n 4) Reduction in the long-term remodelling of heart and blood vessels. \\n1.2.7.3. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nAngiotensin antagonists are indicated in all symptomatic and asympto\\nmatic \\npatients with Left Ventricular (LV) dysfunction . ACE inhibitors ( e.g., enalapril, \\nlisinopril, or ramipril) have a wide diversity of actions and are considered to be \\n better drugs for the treatment of CHF.  \\n1.2.7.4. \\nAdverse Effects \\nAngiotensin antagonists give  rise to occasional adverse effects that include \\nhypotension, hyperkalemia, angioedema, cough, and syncope. Several studies \\nhave suggested that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors are reduced when \\nthey are given along with aspirin.

ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS \\n \\n1.3.1. \\nIntroduction \\nA condition in which the blood pressure of systemic artery increases beyond the \\nnormal pressure is known as hypertension. Therefore to deliver blood to tissues, \\nthe heart works harder to overcome the increased systemic pressure. This \\nincreased systemic arterial pressure puts strain on \\nthe heart and other arteries, \\n thus resulting in high blood pressure.  \\nBased on the degree of severity, hypertension can be graded as: \\n1) Mild: Diastole up to 104mmHg, \\n2) Moderate: Diastole105-114mmHg, and \\n 3) Severe: Diastole more than 115mmHg. \\nSymptoms of hypertension are: \\n1) Chest pain,  \\n2) Confusion, \\n3) Ear noise or buzzing (tinnitus),  4) Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), \\n5) Nosebleed (epistaxis),  \\n6) Exhaustion (lethargy), and  \\n7) Vision changes. \\n \\n \\nTherapy for hypertensive patients aims at reducing the increased blood pressure. \\nThis is accomplished by administration of drugs from different classes; t reatment \\nis often given in the form of a combination of several agents. If left untreated, it \\nwould result in organ damage, thus an increased risk for MI and stroke.  \\n \\n1.3.2. \\nClassification \\nThe antihypertensive agents are classified into the following classes: \\n1) Diuretics \\ni) \\nThiazides: Hydrochlorothiazide, Chlorthalidone, and Indapamide. \\nii) Loop Diuretics: Furosemide, Bumetanide, and Torsemide. \\niii) K+ Sparing Diuretics: Spironolactone, Amiloride, and Triamterene. \\n2) Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: Captopril, Enalapril, Lisinopril, \\nRamipril, Perindopril, Fosinopril, Trandolapril, Quinapril, and Benazepril.\\n \\n3) Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists: \\nLosartan, Candesartan, Valsartan, \\nEprosartan, and Irbesartan. \\n4) Ganglion Blockers: Trimethaphan. \\n5) Adrenergic Drugs \\ni) \\nCentrally Acting D\\nrugs: Clonidine, Methyldopa, Guanabenz, and \\nGuanfacine. \\nii) Adrenergic Neuron Blockers: Guanethidine and Reserpine. \\niii) Sympatholytics (Adrenergic Receptor Blockers) \\na) \\uf061 Blockers: Prazosin, Terazosin, Doxazosin, Phenoxybenzamine, \\nand Phentolamine. \\nb) \\uf062 Blockers: Propranolol, Atenolol, Esmolol, and Metoprolol. \\nc) \\uf061+\\uf062 Blockers: Labetalol and Carvedilol. \\n', 'link': []}, 26: {'text': '26 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n6) Calcium \\nChannel Blockers: \\nVerapamil, Nifedipine, Nicardipine, \\nNimodipine, Amlodipine, and Felodipine. \\n7) Vasodilators \\ni) Arteriolar Dilators: Hydralazine, Minoxidil, and Diazoxide. \\nii) Arteriolar and Venular Dilators: Sodium nitroprusside. \\n \\n1.3.3. \\nDiuretics \\nDrugs promoting urine output are known as diuretic\\ns. They act directly on the \\nkidneys and primarily increase the excretion of water and ions [so\\ndium (Na +), \\nchloride (Cl−) or bicarbonates (\\n\\uf02d\\n3\\nHCO )] from the body.  \\n \\nThe antihypertensive action of diuretics is that they promote the excretion of \\nsodium and water resulting in: \\n1) Decreased plasma volume \\uf0ae \\uf0af cardiac output \\uf0ae \\uf0af BP \\n2) Decreased body sodium \\uf0ae relaxation of vascular smooth m uscles (due to \\nNa+ ion depletion in the vascular smooth muscle) \\uf0ae \\uf0af PVR \\uf0ae \\uf0af BP. \\n \\nThe amount of diuretic required will be reduced if the intake of dietary salt is \\nrestricted. Some common drugs used as diuretics are: \\n1) Thiazides: These diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone) are \\nthe inexpensive first -line antihypertensive agents. They are commonly used \\nin hypertension treatment.  \\n2) Loop Diuretics: \\nThese diuretics (\\ne.g., furosemide, bumetanide, and \\ntorsemide) are powerful diuretics but have low an\\ntihypertensive efficacy. \\nThey are used only in hyper tensive patients having chronic renal failure or \\ncongestive heart failure. They are included in the treatment of malignant \\nhypertension and hypertension with hypervolemia (\\ne.g., \\nrenal \\ninsufficiency).  \\n3) Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: These diuretics (\\ne.g., spironolactone, \\namiloride, and triamterene) have comparatively low efficacy; however, they \\ncorrect the po tassium loss caused by thiazide  and loop diuretics. They are \\nused in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. \\n \\n1.3.3.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe three commonly used diuretics act as follows: \\n1) Thiazides and Thiazide-like Diuretics: Thiazide (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) \\nand thiazide-like diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone, indapamide, and metolazone) \\nincrease the excretion of Na+ ions t hrough urine by inhibiting the sodium -\\nchloride pump in the early segment of the distal convoluted tubule. This \\ninitially reduces the plasma volume, which increases the plasma renin \\nactivity and aldosterone. Ultimately, vascular resistance decrea ses by some \\nuncertain mechanisms because plasma volume approaches the pre -treatment \\nlevels. \\n2) Loop Diuretics: These diuretics act at the thick ascending loop of Henle to \\nprevent the reabsorption of Cl− and Na+ ions from the urine. Their onset of \\naction in comparison to thiazide diuretics is rapid. \\n', 'link': []}, 27: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n27 \\n*  \\n* \\n3) Potassium-Sparing Diuretics:  These diuretics decrease the excretion of\\n \\nMg2+ and K+ ions. Amiloride and triamterene inhibit the Na/proton exchanger \\nin the distal and collecting tubules. They block the epithelial sod\\nium \\ntransport channel. Spironolactone inhibits the Na/K exchanger affected by \\naldosterone, as it is a potent non\\n-selective aldosterone blocker which \\ninteracts with androgen and progesterone receptors. \\n \\n1.3.3.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nDiuretics are used in the treatment of the following conditions:  \\n1) Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics are effective in reducing the incidences of \\nstrokes, heart failure, or total cardiovascular mortality. \\n2) Combination of a thiazide diuretic and potassium -sparing diuretic in a fixed \\ndose reduces the potassium and magnesium wasting. \\n3) Diuretics can be effectively used in obese, elderly, and diabetic patients. They \\nare used in patients with systolic heart failure and excess sodium intake.  \\n4) Thiazide diuretics increase calcium level and decrease osteoporosis.  \\n5) Spironolactone reduces mortality and morbidity in cases of advanced heart \\nfailure. \\n6) Eplerenone decreases cardiovascular mortality in patients who sustained a \\nmyocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction. This drug is useful in \\nthe treatment of resistant hypertension and diabetes mellitus. \\n \\nLoop diuretics are ineffective in hypertensive patients having normal renal \\nfunction. Loop diuretics are used in patients with serum cre\\natinine level more \\nthan 2.5mg/dl. Intravenous doses of furosemide  in cases of heart failure produce \\nan acute vasodilator effect. \\n  \\n1.3.3.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThiazide diuretics give rise to many metabolic effects such as hypercalcaemia, \\nhypokalaemia, hypernatremia, hypomagnesaemia, hypercalcaemia, \\nhyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and hyperuricemia; however, in low doses, \\ntheir side effects are minimised. They may also cause go ut, sexual dysfunction, \\nand sulphonamide-related skin eruptions (occasionally). \\n \\nLoop diuretics produce quite intense metabolic imbalances like hypokalaemia \\nand hypocalcaemia, thus are not prescribed as initial monotherapy for \\nhypertension. \\n \\n1.3.3.4. \\nIndividual Drugs \\nSome commonly used diuretics are discussed below: \\n1) Hydrochlorothiazide: This prototype agent of thiazide diuretic reduces the \\nelectrolyte reabsorption from the renal tubules , thus increases the excretion \\nof water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium). It is \\nused in several disorders like oedema, hypertension, diabetes insipidus, and \\nhypoparathyroidism. \\n2) Furosemide: Chemically, it is a benzoic-sulfonamide-furan compound. It has a \\nfast onset of action and short duration of action. It is used in oedema associated \\n', 'link': []}, 28: {'text': '28 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nwith CHF, liver cirrhosis, renal disease (including nephrotic syndrome) , and \\nchronic renal insufficiency. Furosemide either alone  or in combination with \\nother antihypertensive drugs is used for treating hypertension.\\n \\n3) Spironolactone: This potassium sparing diuretic antagonises the aldosterone \\nin the distal renal tubules. It is used in the treatment of refractory oedema in \\npatients with CHF, nephrotic syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis.  \\n \\n1.3.4. \\nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors \\nACE inhibitors act by inhibiting the action of ACE enzyme. The y competitively \\ninhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II occurring in the presence \\nof angiotensin-converting enzyme. This results in lower levels of angiotensin II, \\nwhich is a potent vasoconstrictor. Lower levels of angiotensin II increase plasma \\nrenin activity and reduce aldosterone secretion. \\n \\n1.3.4.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nACE inhibitors slow down the formation of angiotensin II and as a result, \\nvascular resistance, blood volume, and blood pressure are reduced. Renin is an \\nenzyme which the kidneys release in res ponse to reduced renal blood circulation \\nor hyponatremia. This enzyme acts in the plasma angiotens\\ninogen to produce \\nangiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II (mainly in the lungs). \\n \\nAngiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and also helps \\nin sodium retention by \\nreleasing aldosterone. Angiotensin II is converted to angiotensin III in adrenal \\ngland. Aldosterone release is stimulated by both angiotensin II and angiotensin \\nIII. Angiotensin I is inactive in the cardiovascular system, while angio\\ntensin II \\nhas some cardiovascular -renal actions. The angiotensin -converting enzyme is \\nmostly found in the lungs; however they are also found in kidneys, central \\nnervous system, and some other body tissues also. \\n \\n1.3.4.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe ACE inhibitors have the following therapeutic uses:  \\n1) Hypertension: They are the first line drugs for the treatment of all grades of \\nhypertension. Around 50% of patients respond to monotherapy with ACE \\ninhibitors, and majority of the remaining respond to the combination of ACE \\ninhibitors with diuretics or β-blockers. The hypotensive effect of lower doses \\ndevelops over 2-3 weeks.  \\n2) Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):\\n They cause arteriolar as well as \\nvasodilatation in CHF patients, and also reduce both after -load and pre-load. \\nThey do not  produce any direct myocardial action, thus increasing stroke \\nvolume and cardiac output while reducing the heart rate. Accumulated salt \\nand water are lost due to improved renal perfusion and abolition of \\nmineralocorticoid mediated Na+ ion retention occurs.  \\n3) Myocardial Infarction (MI):  Oral administration of ACE inhibitors \\nis \\ncontinued for 6 weeks . It results in reduction of the early and long\\n-term \\nmortality, regardless of the presence or absence of systolic dysfunction, \\nprovided hypotension is avoided. In p atients with high risk and those with \\n', 'link': []}, 29: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n29 \\n*  \\n* \\nlatent or overt ventricular dysfunction (CHF), the therapy is continued to \\nafford survival benefit over years. \\n4) Prophylaxis in High Cardiovascular Risk Subjects:  They reduce the risk \\nof heart failure or diabetes; thus, \\nact as protective in subjects with a high \\ncardiovascular risk even when there is no associated hypertension or left \\nventricular dysfunction. \\n5) Diabetic Nephropathy:  Prolonged therapy of ACE inhibitors prevents or \\ndelays the end stage renal disease in type\\ns I  and II diabetic patients. \\nAlbuminuria remains stable in patients on ACE inhibitor, but worsens in \\nuntreated diabetic patients.  \\n6) Scleroderma Crisis:  Angiotensin II mediates the marked rise in BP and \\ndeterioration of renal function in scleroderma crisis. AC E inhibitors improve \\nthis condition and are lifesaving. \\n \\n1.3.4.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nIn most of the patients\\n, ACE inhibitors do not produce any side effects or \\ntoxicities but some of  the rarely occurring or d ose related adverse effects are \\ndizziness, angioedema, loss of taste,  photosensitivity, severe hypotension,  dry \\ncough, hyperkalaemia, blood dyscrasias, and renal impairment. \\n \\n1.3.4.4. \\nIndividual Drugs \\nThe commonly used ACE inhibitors are discussed below: \\n1) Captopril: It is a sulfhydryl -containing dipeptide substitute of proli ne. It \\nabolishes the pressor action of only a ngiotensin I, i.e., it does not block the \\nangiotensin II receptors. It is a potent and competitive ACE inhibitor, which \\nis responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II  (an agent \\nwhich regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the RAAS). \\n \\nCaptopril administered with thiazide diuretics is used for treating essential or \\nrenovascular hypertension. In combination with other drugs (\\ne.g., cardiac \\nglycosides, diuretics, and β-adrenergic blockers), it is used to treat congestive \\nheart failure. It improves the survival in patients having left ventricular \\ndysfunction following myocardial infarction. \\n \\nStudies show that if daily dose is kept below 150mg, captopril is well\\n-\\ntolerated in most of the \\npatients, but some mild adverse reactions  like \\nhypotension, hyperkalaemia, cough, rashes, urticaria, angioedema, dysgeusia, \\nfetopathic, headache, dizziness, nausea, \\nbowel upset,  granulocytopenia, \\nproteinuria, and acute renal failure, may occur. \\n2) Enalapril: It is the second drug of this class which is a prodrug, converted \\ninto enalaprilat (a tripeptide analogue). This converted form is not effective \\norally due to poor absorption, \\nthus is available as injectable preparation. \\nEnalaprilat is a potent and competitive ACE blocker, which is responsible for \\nthe conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.   \\n \\nEnalaprilat is used in essential or renovascular hypertension and symptomatic \\ncongestive heart failure, either alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics.\\n \\n', 'link': []}, 30: {'text': '30 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nThe same adverse effects are produced by all the ACE inhibitors. Some \\nadditional adverse effects of enalapril are blurred vision, confusion, dizziness, \\nfaintness, or light-headedness (when getting up suddenly from a lying or sitting \\nposition), unusual tiredness or weakness, chest pain, cough producing mucus, \\ndiarrhoea, laboured breathing, fainting, fever or chills, nausea, and sore throat.  \\n \\n1.3.5. \\nAngiotensin II Receptor Antagonists \\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists [or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker \\n(ARBs)/AT1-receptor antagonists/ Sartans] act by modulating the renin\\n-\\nangiotensin-aldosterone system. They are mainly used in th\\ne treatment of \\nhypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and congestive heart failure. \\n \\n1.3.5.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe ARBs inhibit the final step of Renin\\n-Angiotensin System  (RAS). These \\nagents block the interaction between angiotensin II and its type 1 receptor (AT1), \\nwhich mediates all the pressor effects of this hormone and some of its effects that \\npromote atherosclerosis. In comparison to ACE inhibitors, ARBs cause more \\ncomplete antagonism of angiotensin II, as angiotensin II can also be produced by \\n non-ACE pathways (figure 1.3). \\nARBs are preferred over ACE inhibitors because they do not increase bradykinin \\nwhich causes dry cough. \\n \\n1.3.5.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nAngiotensin II receptor antagonists have the following uses: \\n1) These agents are mainly used in the prevention of hyperte\\nnsion where the \\npatient is intolerant to ACE inhibitor therapy. \\n2) They are used in the treatment of heart failure in patients intolerant to ACE \\ninhibitor therapy, particularly candesartan.

Mild and occasional headache, dizziness, weakness, and \\nupper gastrointestinal side effects are observed. Losartan has a uricosuric effect. \\n \\n1.3.6. \\nGanglion Blockers \\nGanglionic blockers block the sympathetic as well as  parasympathetic ganglia, \\nthus decreasing sympathetic tone and blood pressure.

It is given via \\nintravenous route to produce controlled hypotension during certain surgeries for \\nits rapid and short action (15 minutes).  \\n \\n1.3.6.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nTrimethaphan acts by preventing the stimulation of postsynaptic receptors by \\ncompeting for these receptor sites with acetylcholine.

This class of antihypertensive agents is \\nfurther divided into five sub-classes on the basis of their mode of action: \\n1) Centrally acting sympatholytic drugs,  \\n2) Adrenergic neuron blockers,  \\n3) α-Adrenergic receptor antagonists,  \\n4) β-Adrenergic receptor antagonists, and  \\n5) Mixed (α+β) adrenergic receptor antagonists. \\n \\n1.3.7.1. \\nCentrally Acting Sympatholytic Drugs \\nThe pharmacological profile of centrally acting symp atholytic drugs is similar to \\nthat of prazosin; however the pharmacokinetic profile differs. Clonidine, \\n\\uf061-\\nmethyldopa, guanabenz, and guanfacine are the \\nexamples of centrally acting \\nsympatholytic drugs. Some of the common members of this class are:  \\n1) Methyldopa: It is an α2-adrenergic agonist having central \\nand peripheral \\nnervous system effects. It is mainly used as an antihypertensive agent. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nIn the CNS, methyldopa gets decarboxylated to α-methyl noradrenaline which \\nstimulates the central α-adrenergic receptors. As a result, the sympathetic \\noutflow from the CNS is reduced, resulting in decreased blood pressure. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nMethyldopa is used in hypertension. It was one of the earliest \\n antihypertensive agents available and is still used widely. \\nAdverse Effects \\nNasal stuffiness, headache, sedation, mental depression, dryness of mouth, \\nbradycardia, impotence, extrapyramidal symptoms (due to false transmitter), \\ngynaecomastia, and haemolytic anaemia (rarely) are some common adverse \\neffects of methyldopa. \\n \\n2) Clonidine: It is an imidazoline\\n-derivative and is a centrally\\n-acting α2-\\nadrenergic agonist. It crosses the blood\\n-brain barrier and acts on the \\nhypothalamus to decrease the blood pressure.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nClonidine stimulates α2-adrenergic recepto rs in the CNS and reduces the \\nsympathetic tone, which further decreases the systolic and diastolic blood \\npressure and heart rate.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\ni) In hypertension,  \\nii) To treat withdrawal symptoms in opioid and alcohol addicts,  \\niii) As a pre-anaesthetic agent,  \\niv) As an anti-diarrhoeal in diabetic neuropathy, and \\nv) For prophylaxis of migraine.  \\n', 'link': []}, 33: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n33 \\n*  \\n* \\nAdverse Effects \\nClonidine causes dry mouth and eyes, sedation, depression, bradycardia, \\nimpotence, nausea, dizziness, parotid gland swelling, and pain.  \\n \\nOn suddenly stopping  the use of clonidine after prolonged use, withdrawal \\nsyndrome occurs characterised by headache, nervousness, tachycardia, \\nsweating, tremors, palpitation, and rebound hypertension. \\n \\n1.3.7.2. \\nAdrenergic Neuron Blockers \\nAdrenergic neuron blockers act directly on α- or β-receptors, and produce similar \\neffects as those produced by the stimulation of sympathetic nerves or by the \\nrelease of  epinephrine from the medulla of  adrenal gland.

It is a slow acting drug which shows its complete effect within 2 -\\n3 weeks. Its hypotensive action is due to depletion of NA from peripheral \\n adrenergic nerve endings. It has both central and peripheral actions. \\nMechanism of Action \\nReserpine acts by inhibiting the uptake and storage of DA and NA (vesicular \\ncatecholamines), as it can enter the adrenergic neuron to bind with the \\nstorage vesicle (figure 1.4).

It prevents \\nthe norepinephrine (NE) release at nerve endings and causes NE depletion in \\nperipheral sympathetic nerve terminals and tissues. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nGuanethidine acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction and inhibits or \\ninterferes with NE release and/or distribution. It is taken up by \\nthe NE \\ntransporters, and becomes concentrated in NE transmitter vesicles, where it \\n replaces the NE.  \\nThis gradually depletes the NE stores in the nerve endings.

These \\nagents directly act on vascular smooth muscle\\ns, therefore are effective in \\nlowering blood pressure, regardless of the cause of hypertension. Vasodilators do \\nnot cause orthostatic hypotension and impotence as they do not inhibit the \\n activity of sympathetic nervous system like other antihypertensive drugs.  \\nThe vasodilators relax the ar terial smooth muscles more than the venous smooth \\nmuscles; thus they reduce postural hypotension. \\n \\n1.3.9.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nVarious studies suggest that each vasodilator has a different mechanism and act \\ndifferently in a step -by-step process which couple excita tion of vascular smooth \\n', 'link': []}, 39: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n39 \\n*  \\n* \\nmuscle cells with contraction. For example, the CCBs either inhibit or limit the \\ninflux of Ca2+ ions through the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane via voltage-\\ndependent channels.

Relaxation of \\nvascular smooth muscles occurs due to increase in potassium conductance which \\n causes hyperpolarisation in cell membrane.  \\nAnother class of drugs known as nitrovasodilators (e.g., nitroprusside) activate the \\nsoluble guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscles and increase the intracellular \\nlevels of cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP), thereby causing relaxation in \\nvascular smooth muscles. It has been seen that nitrovasodilators act like endogenous \\nvasodilator released by a variety of endothelial cells of blo\\nod vessels. This \\nendogenous vasodilator (formerly named as Endothelial-Derived Relaxing Factor or \\nEDRF) is nitric oxide or a closely related nitrosothiol compound. \\n \\n \\n1.3.9.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nVasodilators have the following therapeutic uses: \\n1) Nitroprusside is the drug of choice in hypertensive emergencies. \\n2) It is used when myocardial work is to be reduced for a shorter time period (as \\nin myocardial infarction). \\n \\n1.3.9.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe common adverse effects of vasodilators are t achycardia, angina, headache, \\ndizziness, fluid retention, nasal congestion, and hepatitis. \\n \\n1.3.9.4. \\nIndividual Drugs \\nSome commonly used vasodilators are: \\n1) Arteriolar Vasodilator\\n \\n- \\nMinoxidil: \\nChemically, \\nit belongs to \\ndialkylarylamines ( aliphatic aromatic amines in which the amino group is \\nlinked to two aliphatic chains and one aromatic group). \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nMinoxidil is a powerful arteriolar dilator which is effective when given via \\noral route.

ANTI-ANGINAL DRUGS \\n \\n1.4.1. \\nIntroduction \\nAngina pectoris (or chest pain) is a symptom experien\\nced due to myocardial \\nischemia,  wherein the blood supply to the heart decreases. As a result,  the \\nheart muscles do not get sufficient oxygen and nutrient\\ns, and fails  to work \\n properly. \\nThe following two types of angina are mainly seen: \\n1) Classic Angina (Angina of Exercise):  This angina pain occurs w hen the \\ndemand of oxygen exceeds the s\\nupply of oxygen, most commonly due to \\ndiminished coronary flow. \\n2) Vasospastic (Prinzmetal’s or Variant) Angina:  This angina pain occurs at \\nrest and is characterised by reversible coronary vasospasm\\n, which in tu rn \\nreduces the supply of oxygen.  \\n \\nSome individuals however show mixed angina, characterised by both exercise -\\ninduced and resting attacks of angina. \\nSodium nitroprusside \\nNitric oxide  \\nGuanylyl cyclase  \\nGTP \\ncGMP \\nVasodilation  \\nBP \\nFigure 1.5: Mechanism of Action \\n\", 'link': []}, 41: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n41 \\n*  \\n* \\nPatients may also suffer from symptoms like:  \\n1) Weakness,  \\n2) Heartburn, \\n3) Cramping,  \\n4) Indigestion, \\n5) Sweating, \\n6) Nausea, and \\n7) Shortness of breath.  \\n \\n \\n \\nAnti-anginal drug therapy aims at restoring the balance between the supply and \\ndemand of oxygen in the ischemic area of the myocardium. \\n \\n1.4.2. \\nClassification  \\nThe anti-anginals are divided into the following groups:  \\n1) Vasodilator Drugs \\ni) Organic Nitrites and Nitrates\\n: Amyl ni trite, Isosorbide dinitrate,  \\nIsosorbide mononitrate, and Nitroglycerine. \\nii) Calcium Channel Blockers : Amlodipine, Nifedipine, Diltiazem, and  \\nVerapamil. \\niii) Potassium Channel Opener: Nicorandil. \\n2) \\uf062-Adrenoceptor Antagonists (\\uf062-Blockers): Atenolol, Metoprolol, Nadolol, \\nand Propranolol. \\n3) Metabolic Modifiers: Ranolazine and Trimetazidine. \\n \\n1.4.3. \\nOrganic Nitrites and Nitrates \\nOrganic nitrites and nitrates are simple nitric and \\nnitrous acid esters of glycerol having dif\\nferent \\nvolatilities (e.g., isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide \\nmononitrate are so\\nlids at room temperature, \\nnitroglycerine is moderately volatile, and amyl \\nnitrite is highly volatile). These compounds are \\nused in angina pectoris. They rapidly reduce the \\nmyocardial oxygen demand, followed by rapid \\nrelief of symptoms. They are effective in classic as \\nwell as in variant angina pectoris. \\n \\n1.4.3.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nNitrates inhibit coronary vasoconstriction or spasm \\nas a result of which perfusion of the myocardium \\nincreases, thus, relieving vasospastic angina. \\nNitrates also cause venodilation, resulting \\nin \\ndecreased \\npreload and myocardial oxygen \\nconsumption. Due to this action, nitrates are \\n effectively used in classic angina. \\nIt is believed that organic nitrates ( e.g., nitroglycerine) act on vascular smooth \\nmuscles and relax  them by their intracellular conversion to nitrite ions and then \\nto nitric oxide. It results in activation of guanylate cyclase and elevates the levels \\nof cGMP.

If taken via sub\\n-lingual route , it acts \\nrapidly and its action lasts for an hour. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nNitroglycerine acts by dilating the blood vessels , thus affecting the vascular \\nsmooth muscles. It decreases the cardiac oxygen demand in case of stable \\nangina, and increases the oxygen supply in variant angina.  \\n \\nNitroglycreine is also available in the form of patches and topical ointment. Its \\ntransdermal patches are used once daily due to their slower but longer effect. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nNitroglycerine is administered sublingually for the treatment of acute anginal \\npain or for prevention of angina; w hile it’s intravenous administration helps \\n to reduce hypertension. \\nAdverse Effects \\nNitroglycerine causes headache (due to vascular dilation), syncope (due to \\npostural hypotension and reflex tachycardia), apprehension, blurred vision, \\nweakness, vertigo, and dizziness. Some serious adverse effects are \\ncirculatory collapse and anaphylactic reactions. \\n \\n2) Isosorbide Mononitrate and Isosorbide Dinitrate: \\nThese drugs provide  \\nlonger duration of action than nitroglycerine. \\nIsosorbide mononitrate is \\navailable as chewable tablets; while \\nisosorbide dinitrate is formulated as \\nsublingual tablets. \\n \\nBoth isosorbide mononitrate and isosorbide dinitrate are long -acting nitrates. \\nThe former does not undergo the first-pass metabolism. It decreases pre-load, \\nleft ventricular end volume, diastolic pressure, and thus the m\\nyocardial \\noxygen consumption. The latter relaxes the vascular smooth muscles to dilate \\nthe peripheral blood vessels.  \\n \\nBoth the drugs  effectively treat all types of angina pectoris. Isosorbide \\ndinitrate relieves acute anginal attack and manages long\\n-term a ngina \\n pectoris. Isosorbide mononitrate is not used to treat acute attacks of angina. \\nThe most common adverse effects of these drugs are headache, hypotension, \\nfacial flushing,  dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. The \\nadhesives used in transdermal patches can produce allergic reactions, and the \\nsublingual dosage forms can cause burning or stinging under the tongue. \\n', 'link': []}, 43: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n43 \\n*  \\n* \\n1.4.4. \\nCalcium Channel Blockers \\nThe following f our chemically distinct classes of  calcium channel blockers are  \\ncurrently used to treat angina:  \\n1) Phenylalkylamines: Verapamil.  \\n2) Benzothiazepines: Diltiazem. \\n3) Dihydropyridines: Nifedipine, Nimodipine, and Nicardipine. \\n4) Diarylaminopropylamine Ethers: Bepridil. \\n \\n1.4.4.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nCCBs act by blocking the voltage -sensitive calcium channels. They act on the \\ninner side of the membrane and bind to the channels in depolarised membrane\\n. \\nAs a result of drug binding\\n, the channels open rarely after depolarisation. A \\nmarked decrease in transmembrane Ca2+ ion current relaxes the smooth muscles. \\n \\n1.4.4.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nCCbs are used for the treatment of stable as well as variant angina. In variant \\nangina, they cause relaxation of coronary artery spasm\\n, thus increasing the \\ncardiac oxygen supply; while in stable angina, they cause relaxation of peripheral \\narterioles, resulting in decreased afterload and cardiac oxygen demand. \\nVerapamil and diltiazem moderately reduce oxygen demand by suppressing the \\nheart rate and contractility. \\n \\n1.4.4.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nCCBs give rise to c ardiovascular adverse effects. Blood pressure reduces due to \\ndilation of peripheral arterioles , resulting in induced reflex tachycardia. This \\nreaction mainly occurs with nifedipine and rarely with verapamil and diltiazem. \\nDue to their suppressant effects o n the heart, verapamil and diltiazem should be \\nused carefully in patients taking β-blockers and suffering from bradycardia, heart \\nfailure, or AV block.  \\n \\n1.4.4.4. \\nIndividual Drugs \\nSome commonly used CCBs are described below: \\n1) Verapamil: It is a calcium channel blocker of class IV anti\\n-arrhythmic \\nagent. It acts by inhibiting the voltage-dependent calcium channels. Due to \\nits effect on L-type calcium channels in the heart, ionotropy and chronotropy \\nis reduced, which further reduces heart rate and blood pressure. \\nVerapamil is used for the treatment of hypertension and angina. \\n \\nThe common adverse eff ects of v erapamil are myocardial depression, heart \\nfailure, and oedema. Peripheral vasodilating effects may also occur which \\nreduces the afterload and blood pressure. The peripheral effects of verapamil \\ninclude headache, reflex tachycardia, and fluid retention. \\n \\n2) Nifedipine: This drug is a long - as well as short -acting 1,4-dihydropyridine \\ncalcium channel blocker.  It acts by decreasing the contractility of arterial \\nsmooth muscles and also vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of \\nCa2+ \\nions through L-type calcium channels.  \\n', 'link': []}, 44: {'text': '44 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nThis inhibition in turn blocks the contractility of smooth muscle cells, and \\ncauses dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen \\nsupply to myocardial tissues, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased \\nsystemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload. These vasodilatory effects \\noverall decreases the blood pressure. \\n \\nNifedipine is used in the treatment of\\n vasospastic angina, chronic stable \\nangina, hypertension, and Raynaud’s phenomenon. It can also be used as a \\nfirst line agent for left ventricular hypertrophy and for isolated systolic \\n hypertension (long-acting agents). \\nCommon adverse effects of nifedipine include palpitation, flushing, ankle \\noedema, hypotension, headache, drowsiness, and nausea. \\n \\n3) Bepridil: It is a long-acting, non-elective, calcium channel blocker showing \\nsignificant anti -anginal activity. It shows significant coronary vasodilation \\nand moderate peripheral effects.  \\n \\nIt gives inhibitory effects on the slow calcium (L-type) as well as fast sodium \\ninward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscles. Bepridil acts by \\ninhibiting the binding of calcium with calmodulin protein , and further \\nblocking the voltage and receptor operated calcium channels. It also blocks \\nthe transmembrane influx of Ca2+ ions into the cardiac and vascular smooth \\nmuscles.  \\n \\nBepridil is used for the treatment of hypertension and chronic stable angina \\n(classic effort-associated angina). \\n \\nAdverse effects of bepridil are  abnormally fast or slow heartbeat,  severe \\ndizziness, chest pain, psychosis, jaundice, and swelling of legs or ankles. \\n \\n1.4.5. \\nPotassium Channel Openers \\nThe potassium channel  openers which were used earlier for the treatment of \\nsevere hypertension and hypertensive eme rgencies are minoxidil and diazoxide;  \\nbut use of these agents has been reduced after synthesis of some novel potassium \\nchannel openers, like nicorandil, pinacidil, and cromakalim.  \\n \\n1.4.5.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nPotassium channel openers activate (open) the ATP -sensitive K +-channels in \\nvascular smooth muscles. These opened channels hyperpolarise the smooth \\nmuscles, which further closes the voltage -gated calcium channels and decreases \\nintracellular calcium. Since less calcium is available to bind with calmodulin, \\nless activation of myosin light chain kinase and less phosphorylation of myosin \\nlight chains occur. This results in relaxation and vasodilation. \\n \\n1.4.5.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nPotassium channel openers are  used in patients who have undergone optimal \\nmanagement wit h other d rugs, but still remain  symptomatic, often while they \\nawait surgery or angioplasty. \\n', 'link': []}, 45: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n45 \\n*  \\n* \\n1.4.5.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nCommon adverse effects o f potassium channel openers are f lushing, palpitation, \\nweakness, headache, mouth ulcers, nausea, and vomiting. \\n \\n1.4.5.4. \\nIndividual Drug - Nicorandil \\nNicorandil is a derivative of niacinamide. It activates the potassium channels and \\ncauses vasodilation of arterioles and large coronary arteries. \\n \\nNicorandil acts as a nitrate and activates ATP -sensitive potassium channels in \\nvascular smooth muscles, thus leading to vasodilation in coronary, arterial, and \\nvenous system. This in turn reduces preload, afterload, and myocardial oxygen \\nconsumption. \\n \\nNicorandil is used for preventing and treating chronic stable angina pectoris, and \\nfor reducing the risk of acute coronary syndromes. \\n \\nCommon adverse effects of nicorandil include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and \\nfacial flushing. Angina, palpitations, mouth ulcers, myalgia, angioedema, \\nbronchitis, and dyspnoea occur rarely. \\n \\n1.4.6. \\nβ-Adrenoceptor Antagonists \\nThe β-adrenergic blockers commonly used in angina are \\natenolol, metoprolol, \\nnadolol, and propranolol.  \\n \\n1.4.6.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe β-adrenergic antagonists decrease the oxygen demand by reducing the heart \\nrate.

ANTI-ARRHYTHMIC DRUGS \\n \\n1.5.1. \\nIntroduction \\nArrhythmia is a common disorder of cardiac excitation, which may be benign but \\nmay also be fatal (\\ne.g., ventricular fibrillation following a heart attack). \\n Antiarrhythmic drugs are used to control or correct cardiac rhythm. \\nFour types of arrhythmias are:  \\n1) Atrial fibrillation, \\n2) Bradycardia, \\n3) Tachycardia, and \\n4) Ventricular arrhythmias. \\n \\nThe symptoms of arrhythmias are:  \\n1) Shortness of breath, \\n2) Feeling tired or light-headed, \\n3) Rapid thumping in chest or palpitations, \\n4) Chest pain, and \\n 5) Losing consciousness.  \\n1.5.2. \\nClassification  \\nThe classification of antiarrhythmic drugs is as follows: \\n \\nTable 1.1: Classes of Antiarrhythmic Drugs \\nClasses \\nBasic Mechanism \\nExamples \\nI \\nSodium Channel \\nBlockers \\nReduce phase 0 slope and peak of action \\npotential. \\n \\nIA \\nModerate \\nModerate reduction in phase 0 slope; \\nincrease APD; increase ERP. \\nQuinidine and \\nProcainamide. \\nIB \\nWeak \\nSmall reduction in phase 0 slope; reduce \\nAPD; decrease ERP. \\nLidocaine and \\nPhenytoin. \\nIC \\nStrong \\nPronounced reduction in phase 0 slope; no \\neffect on APD or ERP. \\nFlecainide and\\n \\nPropafenone. \\nII \\nβ-Blockers \\nBlock sympathetic activity; reduce rate and \\nconduction. \\nPropranolol and  \\nMetoprolol. \\nIII \\nPotassium \\nChannel Blockers \\nDelay re -polarisation (phase 3) and thereby \\nincrease action potential duration and \\neffective refractory period. \\nAmiodaron and  \\nBretylium.  \\nIV \\nCalcium Channel \\nBlockers \\nBlock L\\n-type calcium\\n-channels; most \\neffective at SA and AV nodes; reduce rate \\nand conduction. \\nVerapamil, \\nDiltiazem, \\nand \\nNifedipine.   \\n', 'link': []}, 48: {'text': '48 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n1.5.3. \\nSodium Channel Blockers (Class I)  \\nSodium channel blockers  are the most wi dely used antiarrhythmic agents. They \\nact by blocking myocardial Na\\n+ ion channels. They are  mainly used for the \\ntreatment of supraventricular, nodal and ventricular arrhythmias , especially after \\nMI and DC shock.  \\n \\n1.5.3.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nAntiarrhythmic activity of sodium channel blockers is due to: \\n1) Decrease in inflow of sodium during phase 0 which slo ws the maximum rate \\nof depolarisation, \\n2) Decrease in excitability and conduction velocity, \\n3) Prolongation of effective refractory period, and \\n4) Decrease in slope of phase 4 spontaneous depolarisation (automaticity). \\n \\n1.5.3.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe sodium channel blockers have the following therapeutic uses: \\n1) Treatment of supraventricular, nodal and ventr icular arrhythmias, especially \\nafter MI and DC shock. \\n2) After treatment of atrial flutter and fibrillation to maintain sinus rhythm. \\n \\n1.5.3.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe adverse effects of sodium channel blockers are \\nmarked depression of AV \\nconduction, hypotension, bradycardia, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. \\n \\n1.5.3.4. \\nIndividual Drugs \\nClass I antiarrhythmic agents are further classified into:  \\n1) Moderate (Class IA): These drugs slow the rate of rise of action potential \\nand prolong the duration of action potential. They block Na+ ion channels and \\nprolong the repolarisation time. \\nExamples \\ni) Quinidine: It is the prototype of Class IA drug. Because of its \\nconcomitant Class III activity, it can precipitate arrhythmias such as \\npolymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( torsades de pointes ), which ca n \\ndegenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Due to the toxic effects,\\n the \\nclinical uses of quinidine are  replaced with calcium antagonists (like \\namiodarone and verapamil). \\n \\nMechanism of Action: Quinidine binds to open and inactivated Na+ ion \\nchannels to pr event the influx of Na+ ions; thus slowing down the rapid \\nupstroke during phase 0. It also reduces the slope of phase 4 spontaneous \\ndepolarisation and inhibits potassium channels. These actions result \\nin \\nslow conduction velocity and increased refractoriness. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses: Quinidine is used in the treatment of a wide variety \\nof arrhythmias including atrial, AV\\n-junctional, and ventricular \\ntachyarrhythmia. It is used to maintain sinus rhythm after direct -current \\ncardioversion of atrial flutter or fibrilla\\ntion and to prevent frequent \\nventricular tachycardia. \\n', 'link': []}, 49: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n49 \\n*  \\n* \\nAdverse Effects \\na) A potential adverse effect of quinidine is development of arrhythmia \\n(torsades de pointes). \\nb) It may cause SA and AV blockage or asystole. \\nc) At toxic levels, it may induce ventricular tachycardia. \\nd) Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are commonly observed. \\ne) In l arge doses , it may induce the symptoms of cinchonism (\\ne.g., \\nblurred vision, tinnitus, headache, disorientation, and psychosis). \\nf) It has a mild α-adrenergic blocking action as well as an atropine-like \\neffect. \\ng) It can increase the steady\\n-state concentration of digoxin by \\ndisplacement of digoxin from tissue -binding sites (minor effect) and \\nby decreasing digoxin renal clearance (major effect). \\n \\nii) Procainamide: It is a derivative of the local anaesthetic procaine and \\nshows actions similar to those of quinidine. \\n \\nMechanism of Action: Procainamide stabilises the neuronal membrane \\nby inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of \\nimpulses, thereby affecting local anaesthetic action. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses: Procainamide can be given in place of quinidine as it is \\nbetter tolerated in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter. It is an \\nalternative to lidocaine in preventi on and treatment of frequent VPBs \\n(Ventricular Premature Beats) and sustained tachycardia after MI. Its use is \\nalso declining because of frequent dosing and unacceptable adverse effects.\\n \\n \\nAdverse Effects: \\nWith chronic use, procainamide causes a high \\nincidence of side effects, including a reversible lupus erythematous -like \\nsyndrome. Toxic concentrations of procainamide may cause asystole or \\ninduction of ventricular arrhythmias. CNS side effects include \\ndepression, hallucination, and psychosis.  \\n \\n2) Weak (Class IB): The characteristic effects of these drugs are reduced rate \\nof rise of action potential and reduced or unchanged APD ( Action Potential \\nDuration). The drugs of Class IB rapidly associate \\nand dissociate from the \\nsodium channels. Thus , their actions are m anifested when the cardiac cells \\nare depolarised or firing rapidly.  \\n \\nExamples \\ni) Lidocaine: It is a local anaesthetic which shortens phase 3 repolarisation \\nand decreases the duration of action potential\\n. Lidocaine is useful in \\ntreating ventricular arrhythmias. It was the drug of choice for emergency \\ntreatment of cardiac arrhythmias. It does not slow down conduction, thus \\nhas a little effect on the AV junction arrhythmia. \\n \\nLidocaine in higher doses causes cardiac and CNS manifestations. SA \\nnodal arrest and hypotension may also occur. Paraesthesia, tremor (facial \\ntwitching), vomiting, light headedness, slurred speech, and convulsions \\nalso occur commonly. \\n', 'link': []}, 50: {'text': '50 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nii) Phenytoin: It is an antiepileptic drug used in tonic\\n-clonic seizures. It \\nproduces unique cardiac electrophys\\niological effects, thus is used in \\ndigoxin-induced arrhythmia. \\n \\nPhenytoin blocks the inactivated sodium channels, thus recovery occurs \\nrapidly and depresses automaticity in ventricular tissues and PF, thus \\nsuppresses DAPs (Delayed After -Polarisations). It facilitates AV nodal \\nconduction, therefore can be suitably used in supraventricuar arrhythmia \\nassociated with AV blocks such as digitalis\\n-induced atrial tachycardia \\nand digoxin-induced ventricular tachycardia. \\n \\nPhenytoin is mainly used in children with con\\ngenital heart disease and \\ncongenital prolonged QT syndrome to treat ventricular tachycardia.  \\n \\nSome common adverse effects of phenytoin include \\ndecreased \\ncoordination, mental confusion, nervousness, slurred speech, trouble \\nwith breathing, speaking, or swal\\nlowing, unsteadiness, trembling, and \\nother problems with muscle control or coordination. \\n \\n3) Strong (Class IC): Drugs of this class are powerful blockers of fast Na + ion \\nchannels, and thus reduce upstroke of AP in normal and diseased \\nmyocardium. There is dela yed inactivation of slow Na + ion channels during \\ndown slope of AP, and this result in prolongation of APD. In addition, there \\nis inhibition of delayed rectifier K\\n+ current (less K + efflux), so the APD is \\nprolonged in His Bundle and Purkinje fibre system.  \\n \\nThese changes create heterogeneity of impulse conduction, non\\n-uniform \\nslowing and unidirectional block predisposing to development of re\\n-entry \\n(proarrhythmic potential). Arrhythmias are more likely to occur in structural \\nheart disease, sympathetic over activity and at faster heart rates. \\n \\nExamples \\ni) Flecainide: It blocks Na + and K + ion channels in normal and ischemic \\nmyocardium, t hus slow ing down the recovery of blocked Na\\n+ ion \\nchannels. It further slows down  the conduction of electrical impulse in \\n the heart, i.e., reduces excitability. \\nFlecainide is useful in terminating PSVT, and treating atrial fibrillation \\nand atrial flutter occurring in normal heart. It stabilises the heart rhythm \\nwhen the heart beats too fast or beats irregularly. \\n \\nCommon adverse effects of flecainide are: \\na) During Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), \\nit causes \\nserious ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden death.  \\nb) During the treatment of atrial fibrillation, it should be administered \\nwith a rate\\n-reducing drug (digoxin) otherwise\\n paradoxical \\ntachycardia may occur.  \\nc) It is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome, bundle branch block and \\nshould be avoided in acute MI.  \\n', 'link': []}, 51: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n51 \\n*  \\n* \\nii) Propafenone: It blocks fast Na\\n+ ion channels and gives \\na mild β-\\nblocking action (1/10 of propranolol) and class\\n-IV action (Ca\\n++ ion \\nchannel block age). QT interval does not change but QRS and PR \\nintervals are prolonged. It is effective orally and is metabolised by CYP \\n2D6 (in persons with CYP 2D6 deficiency, it is slowly metabolised). \\n \\nPropafenone acts by slowing down the influx of Na+ ions into the cardiac \\nmuscle cells, thus decreasing the excitability of the cells.  \\n \\nPropafenone is used in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, for \\nsuppressing supraventricular tachycardia in Wolff\\n-Parkinson-White \\n(WPW) syndrome, i n recurrent atrial fibrillation, and  in suppression of \\nparoxysms of atrial fibrillation. \\n \\nThe main adverse effects of propafenone are constipation, and sometimes \\nit worsens CHF.

They are highly effective in arrhythmias in which \\nexcess of catecholamine plays a role after MI, CHF, pheochromocytoma, anxiety, \\nanaesthesia and postoperative period, exercise and mitr al valve prolapse. Excess \\nof cAMP is considered to be responsible for causing ischemia induced \\nventricular fibrillation.  \\n \\n1.5.4.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nReduction in intracellular Ca ++ ions leads to reduced phase 2 of AP. There is \\nreduction in SA nodal automaticity,  slowing of conduction, and prolongation of \\nERP (Effective Refractive Period ) in AV node. They counteract catecholamine \\ninduced after depolarisations (arrhythmias) by reducing cAMP and Ca\\n++ ion \\naccumulation. \\n \\n\\uf062-blockers are also effective prophylactically \\nin suppressing supraventricular \\ntachycardia because they suppress automaticity of ectopic foci and slow AV \\nnodal conduction , thereby reducing ventricular response in atrial fibrillation. \\nThey reduce cardiac contractility and blood pressure.  \\n \\n1.5.4.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nAt present \\uf062-blockers are considered to be better antiarrhythmic agent s because \\nthey improve survival, have broader spectrum of antiarrhythmic action, and are \\ncomparatively safer.

These medications are used to decrease the risk of \\narteriosclerosis.  \\n \\nThe major drugs for reduction of LDL cholesterol levels are bile acid \\nsequestrants and nicotinic acid.

The most effective \\nagents for reducing plasma LDL levels are the statins. \\n \\n1.6.2. \\nClassification  \\nThe anti- hyperlipidemic drugs are classified into: \\n1) HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibit\\nors (Statins):  Lovastatin, Simvastatin, \\nPravastatin, and Atorvastatin. \\n2) Bile Acid Sequestrants (Resins): Cholestyramine and Colestipol. \\n3) Fibric Acid Derivatives (Fibrates):  Clofibrate, Gemfibrozil, Bezafibrate, \\nand Fenofibrate. \\n4) Triglyceride Synthesis and Lipolysis Inhibitors: Nicotinic acid. \\n5) Others: Probucol and Omega-3 fatty acids. \\n \\n1.6.3. \\nHMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins) \\nStatins are the most effective and best tolerated agents used to treat \\nhyperlipidemia. Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3 -hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl \\ncoenzyme reductase and also the most effective and best tolerated agents for \\ntreating hyperlipidemia.  \\n \\nThey catalyse an early, rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Hi\\ngher \\ndoses are more potent and can even reduce the triglyceride levels caused by high \\nVLDL levels. \\n', 'link': []}, 56: {'text': '56 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n1.6.3.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nStatins inhibit the enzyme 3\\n-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase \\n(HMG-CoA reductase) which catalyses the conversion of HMG\\n-CoA to \\nmevalonate. Mevalonate is required to initiate cholesterol biosynthesis and its \\nproduction is inhibited by statins. Statins act as a competitive inhibitor for HMG-\\nCoA which binds to the HMG -CoA reductase. Statins are  inactive in its native \\nform, so the form in which they are administered is hydrolysed to the β-hydroxy \\nacid form and becomes active. \\n \\n1.6.3.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe therapeutic uses of statins are: \\n1) They are used for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke \\nin patients having symptomatic atherosclerotic disease (e.g., angina, transient \\nischemic attacks, following acute myocardial infarction or stroke). \\n2) They are used for primary prevention of arterial disease in patients having \\nhigh risk due to increased serum cholesterol concentration, specifically when \\nthere are other risk factors for atherosclerosis.  \\n3) Serum cholesterol level can be lowered by atorvastatin in patients with \\nhomozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. \\n4) A bile acid binding resin is added to treatment with a statin in cases of severe \\ndrug-resistant dyslipidaemia (e.g., heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia).\\n \\n \\n1.6.3.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nStatins are generally well -tolerated and adverse  effects are very rare. However, \\nsome patients may experience some mild and transient reactions like h\\neadache, \\nrashes, and GI disturbances (dyspepsia, cramps, flatulence, constipation, and \\nabdominal pain).  \\n \\nSome serious side effects that may occur rarely are hepatotoxicity and myopathy. \\nHowever, some statins give more hazardous reactions than others:  \\n1) Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis: Sometimes statins can cause muscle injury. \\nMild injury characterised by muscles ache, tenderness or weakness localised \\nto certain muscle group occurs in 5-10% patients.   \\n2) Hepatotoxicity: It may develop in 0.5-2% of patients treated for one or more \\nyear with statins. But jaundice and other clinical signs are very rare. Use of \\nstatin in patients with active liver\\n disease depends on the disease;\\n  \\nfor example, statins should not be given to patients suffering from viral or \\nalcoholic hepatitis, while statins use is acceptable in patients of non-alcoholic \\nfatty liver disease.   \\n \\n1.6.3.4. \\nIndividual Drugs \\nSome commonly used statins are discussed below: \\n1) Atorvastatin: It is an aromatic heterocyclic compound belonging to the class \\ndiphenylpyrroles, having a structure based on a pyrrole ring linked to two \\nphenyl groups. \\n \\n', 'link': []}, 57: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n57 \\n*  \\n* \\nAtorvastatin acts by decreasing hepatic cholesterol levels. It is a selective and \\ncompetitive inhibitor of HMG\\n-CoA reductase enzyme which catalyses \\nconversion of HMG -CoA to mevalonate in t\\nhe cholesterol biosynthesis \\npathway. \\n \\nAtorvastatin has the following therapeutic uses:  \\ni) It may be used as a primary prevention in patients of multiple risk factors \\nfor Coronary Heart Disease \\n(CHD) and as secondary prevention in \\nindividuals with CHD to redu ce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), \\nstroke, angina, and revascularisation procedures.  \\nii) It reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with \\nAcute \\nCoronary Syndrome (ACS).  \\niii) It may be used in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and \\nmixed dyslipidaemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, \\nprimary dysbetalipoproteinemia, and/or hypertrigly\\nceridemia as an \\nadjunct to dietary therapy to decrease serum total and \\nLow-Density \\nLipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), an\\nd \\ntriglyceride concentrations, while increasing High-Density Lipoprotein \\nCholesterol (HDL-C) levels. \\n \\nThe common adverse effects occurring with the use of atorvastatin include\\n \\nmuscle pain, confusion, memory problems, fever, \\nunusual tiredness, dark \\ncoloured urine, weight gain, and urinating less than usual or not at all.  \\n \\n2) Lovastatin: It is used as a cholesterol-lowering agent.  It is a prodrug, \\nshowing structural similarity with HMG, a substituent of the endogenous \\nsubstrate of HMG-CoA reductase. It gets activated in vivo by the hydrolysis \\nof lactone ring to form β-hydroxy acid. The hydrolysed lactone ring mimics \\nthe tetrahedral intermediate produced by the reductase. The resultant \\nhydrolysed lactone ring binds to HMG\\n-CoA reductase with 20,000 times \\ngreater affinity than its natural s\\nubstrate. Thus , the bicyclic portion of \\n lovastatin binds to the coenzyme A portion of the active site. \\nLovastatin is used as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total\\n-C, LDL-C, \\napo B, and TG levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and \\nmixed dyslipidaemia. It is also used for primary prevention of CHD and for \\n slow progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with CHD. \\nThe more common adverse effects of lovastatin include gastric disturbance s \\nlike (pain in abdominal area, nausea, heart burn, and constipation), headache, \\nweakness, muscle pain, memory loss, confusion, and inability to fall asleep. \\n \\n1.6.4. \\nBile Acid Sequestrants (Resins) \\nBile acid sequestrants bind with certain components of bile in the gastrointestinal \\ntract. They prevent the re-absorption of bile acids from the gut by disrupting the \\nenterohepatic circulation of bile acids by sequestering them. They may be used \\nfor purposes other than lowering cholesterol, but they are cla\\nssified as \\nhypolipidemic agents.   \\n', 'link': []}, 58: {'text': '58 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n1.6.4.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nBile acid sequestrants are polymeric compounds which act as ion exchange \\nresins. They exchange anions \\n(like Cl− ions) for bile acids by binding with \\nbile acid and sequestering them from enterohepatic \\ncirculation. They are not \\nwell-absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream because they have large \\npolymeric structures. Therefore, the bile acid sequestrants along with \\nthe bile \\nacid bound to the drug\\n, are excreted via faeces after \\npassing through the \\ngastrointestinal tract.  \\n \\n1.6.4.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nBile acid sequestrants are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and \\ndyslipidemia as they help in decreasing the cholesterol levels, mainly low density \\nlipoprotein (commonly known as “bad cholesterol”). They act by inhibiting  the \\nre-absorption of bile acid, which is biosynthesised from cholesterol.  \\n \\nThey may cause pruritus during chronic liver diseases \\n(such as cirrhosis ) \\nbecause the bile acids may deposit in the skin. Therefore, in patients with \\nchronic live r diseases, bile acid sequestrants may be used for the prevention \\nof pruritus.  \\n \\nThey are also used in the treatment of diarrhoea caused by excess bile salts \\nentering the colon rather than being absorbed at the end of the small intestine. \\nDiarrhoea caused by excessive bile is a possible side effect occurring after \\nsurgical removal of gallbladder.  \\n \\n1.6.4.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nBile acid sequestrants do not have any systemic side effects because they are \\ndesigned to stay in the gut. However, they may cause problems like constipation, \\ndiarrhoea, and flatulence in the gastrointestinal tract. \\n \\n1.6.4.4. \\nIndividual Drug - Cholestyramine \\nCholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant which serves as ion exchange resins. It \\nis a quite hydrophilic compound, but insoluble in water. \\n \\nCholestyramine acts by preventing the reabsorption of bile in the gastrointestinal \\ntract.  It binds to bile as it is a strong anion exchange resin which can exchange \\nits chloride anions with anionic bile acids in the GIT and bind them in the resin \\nmatrix strongly.  \\n \\nIt is used as an \\nadjunctive therapy to diet for reducing the increased serum \\ncholesterol in the patients who have primary hypercholesterolemia (elevated \\nLDL cholesterol) and do not respond adequately to diet. It can also be used for \\npruritus associated with partial biliary obstruction. \\n \\nCholestyramine gives rise to many\\n adverse effects which include mild \\nconstipation, diarrhoea, stomach pain, nausea, loss of appetite, weight changes, \\nbloating, hiccups, a sour taste in mouth, skin rashes, itching, irritation  of tongue \\nand around the rectal area, and muscle or joint pain. \\n', 'link': []}, 59: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n59 \\n*  \\n* \\n1.6.5. \\nFibric Acid Derivatives (Fibrates) \\nFibrates are the drugs reducing the triglyceride levels more than LDL cholesterol \\nlevels. The m ost common examples of fibrates are gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, \\nciprofibrate, and fenofibrate. They are the most heterogeneous lipid modifying \\ndrugs. \\n \\n1.6.5.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe mechanism of action of fibrates is not completely understood but it is \\nbelieved tha\\nt they increase peripheral clearance and \\nreduce hepatic \\ntriglyceride synthesis. The effects given by fibrates on blood lipids depend on \\ntheir binding to Peroxisome Proliferators Activator Receptors (PPARs)\\n, \\nwhich regulate gene transcription. \\uf061, \\uf062, and \\uf067 are the three PPAR isotopes \\nthat have been identified.  \\n \\nFibrates act as agonists for the nuclear transcription factor \\nPeroxisome \\nProliferators-Activated Receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), at the molecular level. \\nThis mechanism is used by fibrates for the down reg ulation of the apolipoprotein \\nC-III (apo C-III) gene and up regulation of the genes for apolipoprotein A -I (apo \\nA-I), fatty acid transport protein, fatty acid oxidation, and LPL. Thus, VLDL \\ntriglycerides get reduced due to the enhanced catabolism of trigly cerides by LPL \\nalong with enhanced fatty acid oxidation. \\n \\n1.6.5.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe fibrates are used in the following cases: \\n1) Fibrates (gemfibrozil) are the first -line of drugs f or patients with type III \\nhyperlipidaemia or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. \\n2) They are used to treat mixed \\nhyperlipidaemia, where in the predominant \\nabnormality is hypertriglyceridemia (in combination with resins) and to treat \\nmoderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia. \\n3) They are  used with statins in patients with high risk of CHD and mixed \\nhyperlipidaemia. But because of the increased risk of myopathy, careful \\nsafety monitoring is required.  \\n \\n1.6.5.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nGenerally, fibrates do not give an\\ny adverse reaction and are well\\n-tolerated in \\nmost of the patients. But in some patients minor side -effects like GI disturbance \\nsymptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea may be seen that are \\ncorrected by the discontinuation of the treatment.   \\n \\nAn important but rare adverse effect of fibrates is myositis with muscle pain and \\ntenderness and elevated creatinine kinase levels.  \\n \\nfibrates Are \\ncontraindicated in patients of renal dysfunction\\n, as they get \\naccumulated in the kidney leading to enhanced frequency of adverse effects \\nspecially myositis.     \\n \\n', 'link': []}, 60: {'text': '60 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n1.6.5.4. \\nIndividual Drug - Clofibrate \\nClofibrate is an anti -lipidemic drug that lowers the elevated serum lipids by \\nreducing the very low\\n-density lipoprotein fraction (S\\nf 20-400) rich in \\ntriglycerides. Serum cholesterol may be decreased in those patients whose \\ncholesterol elevation is due to the presence of IDL as\\n a result of Type III \\nhyperlipoproteinemia.  \\n \\nClofibrate enhances lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis by increasing the activity \\nof extrahepatic Lipoprotein Lipase (LL). Degradation of chylomicrons converts \\nVLDLs to LDLs , which are further converted into HD Ls. These changes occur \\nby a minor increase in the secretion of lipids into bile and finally in the \\nintestine.  \\n \\nClofibrate also helps to inhibit the synthesis , and thus increases the clearance of \\napolipoprotein B (a carrier molecule for VLDL).  \\n \\nClofibrate is used to treat \\nprimary dysbetalipoproteinemia \\n(Type III \\nhyperlipidaemia) which does not respond adequately to diet. Thus\\n, it helps to \\ncontrol high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. \\n \\nClofibrate may cause diarrhoea, nausea, headache, dec\\nreased sexual ability, \\nincreased appetite, slight weight gain,  muscle aches or cramps, sores in mouth \\nand on lips, stomach pain, gas, heartburn, unusual tiredness or weakness, and \\nvomiting. \\n \\n1.6.6. \\nTriglyceride Synthesis and Lipolysis Inhibitors \\nTriglyceride synthesis and lipolysis inhibitors \\nact either by inhibiting \\nthe \\nsynthesis of triglyceride or by inhibiting  the process of lipolysis. These agents \\nreduce the level of LDLs and VLDLs in blood, and thus prevent the deposition of \\nlipid in blood vessels. Nicotinic acid is the most common example of this class. \\nHigher doses of nicotinic acid help in the reduction of plasma lipid concentration.  \\n \\nIndividual Drug  \\n1) Nicotinic Acid (Niacin): Nicotinic acid is an organic compound that belongs \\nto the pyridine carboxylic acids group of compounds. At high concentrations, \\nthis drug gives cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effects, resulting in a \\ndecrease of LDLs and VLDLs and an increase in HDLs.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nNicotinic acid helps in \\nthe inhibition of release of free fatty acids from \\nadipose tissue and enhances the lipoprotein activity. It results \\nin increased \\nrate of triglyceride removal from plasma. These actions decrease the total \\nLDL (bad cholesterol) and triglyceride levels, causing increased HDLs (good \\ncholesterol). \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nNicotinic acid is not used therapeutically due to its side effects but \\nsometimes can be prescribed as an adjunct to diet for treatment of high serum \\n', 'link': []}, 61: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS (Chapter 1)  \\n61 \\n*  \\n* \\ntriglyceride levels in adult patients who have a risk of pancreatitis, and who \\ndo not respond properly to dietary control.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nThe major adverse effects \\nof nicotinic acid are headache, anxiety, \\nhypotension, dry skin, flushing or burning of skin, peptic ulcer, and abnormal \\nliver function tests. \\n \\nOther mild ad verse effects are  hyperuricemia, glucose intolerance, nausea, \\nvomiting, diarrhoea, hyperglycaemia, and elevated plasma uric acid. \\n \\n2) Probucol: It helps in the reduction of LDL and HDL levels, but shows \\nminute effects on serum-triglyceride or VLDL cholesterol levels.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nProbucol acts by increasing the fractional rate of LDL catabolism in the \\nfinal metabolic pathway for cholesterol elimination from the body. This \\nresults in t he reduction of serum cholesterol level\\ns. It can also inhibit \\nearly stages of cholesterol biosynthesis and slightly inhibit dietary \\ncholesterol absorpti on. According to recent studies, \\nprobucol can also \\ncontrol atherogenesis as it may inhibit the oxidation\\n and tissue deposition \\nof LDL cholesterol.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nProbucol is used to lower LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe common adverse effects of probucol are dizziness or fainting and fast or \\n irregular heartbeat.  \\nSome rarely occurrin g adver se effects are s\\nwellings on face, hands, or \\nfeet, or in mouth, unusual bleeding or bruising, and\\n unusual tiredness or \\nweakness \\n \\n1.6.7. \\nOther Drugs \\nSome rarely used anti-hyperlipidemic drugs are omega-3 fatty ac ids (fish oils). \\nEicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the omega-3 \\nfatty acids richly found in fish oil ; while linoleic acid is the omega -3 fatty acid \\nobtained from p lant sources, such as mustard oil, canola oil, linseed oil, black \\ngram dal, fenugreek seeds, walnuts, and green  leafy vegetables. EPA and DHA \\nare formed by linoleic acid conversion in the body. Clinical studies have shown \\n that they reduce serious coronary events.  \\nMechanism of Action \\nHepatic VLDL triglyceride  synthesis is reduced by omega -3 fatty acids , thus, \\nreducing the plasma triglyceride levels. Secretion of VLDL apo B is reduced at \\nhigh doses  of omega -3 fatty acids . The triglyceride levels ar e reduced at low \\ndoses of omega -3 fatty acids, \\nbut LDL cholesterol \\nlevels may rise due to \\nconversion of VLDL to LDL\\n-HDL cholesterol. Because of the decrease in \\nthromboxane synthesis, fish oils \\nalso have antiplatelet aggregatory activity. \\nPlasma fibrinogen levels are also reduced. \\n', 'link': []}, 62: {'text': '62 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nTherapeutic Uses \\n1) Fish oils, \\navailable as gela\\ntin \\ncapsules \\nare used\\n \\nin severe \\nhypertriglyceridemia along with fibrates. \\n2) Fish oils along with statins (LDL-C may increase during monotherapy, thus \\nthey should not be used alone) \\nare helpful in patients having mixed \\nhyperlipidaemia with slight increase in triglycerides. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe most common side effect of fish oils is nausea.

DRUGS USED IN THE THERAPY OF SHOCK \\n \\n2.1.1. Introduction \\nShock is a medical condition in which the blood perfusion to the tissues \\ndecreases, resulting in cellular injury and inadequate tissue function. It is a life -\\nthreatening condition signified by rapid\\n heart rate, hypotension (low blood \\npressure), weak pulse, and sign of poor end\\n-organ perfusion (i.e., low urine \\noutput, confusion, or loss of consciousness). \\n \\nShock alters the mental state of the patient and is a state of medical emergency. A \\nstate of sho ck increases lactate metabolism as it leads to anaerobic metabolism. \\nMortality rate in a patient with shock is quite high, even though optimal \\ntreatment is provided in an ICU. \\n \\n2.1.2. Treatment for Cardiovascular Shock  \\nThe treatment of cardiovascular shock involves: \\n1) Primary Therapy: \\nThis therapy aims at correcting the cause (i.e., \\nhaemorrhage, infection, myocardial infarction, and anaphylaxis), and  \\n2) Secondary Therapy: \\nThis therapy \\naims at correcting the associated \\nhemodynamic disturbance. The following drugs are employed for their \\nhemodynamic effects: \\n1) Sympathomimetic amines, \\n2) α-adrenoceptor blocking agents, \\n3) Corticosteroids,  \\n4) Oxygen,  \\n5) Cardiac glycosides, \\n6) Glucagon, and  \\n7) Dextrans. \\n \\n \\n2.1.2.1. \\nSympathomimetic Amines \\nSympathomimetic amines act via β1-adrenoceptors in the heart, \\n\\uf061- and β2-\\nadrenoceptors in the blood vessels, and dopamine receptors in the cerebral, \\ncoronary, mesenteric, and renal vascular beds.  Patients with shock resulting from \\ndecreased circulating volume of blood should be given either blood or plasma \\nvolume expanders. They may later be given sympathomimetic agents for the \\nimprovement of tissue perfusion. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nEither one or more mechan ism of action of sympathomimetic amines helps to \\nmaintain the perfusion of vital organs (brain, heart, and kidney), and other \\nvisceral organs:  \\n1) Increased Myocardial Contractility: \\nSympathomimetic amines increase  \\nthe cardiac output in case of adequate venous return. \\nCHAPTER \\n2 \\n \\n \\n \\nPharmacology of Drugs Acting on \\nCVS and Haemopoietic System \\n', 'link': []}, 67: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n67 \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Constriction of the Capacitance: \\nSympathomimetic amines contract the \\nvessels or venules to prevent venous pooling.  \\n3) Dilation of Resistance: Sympathomimetic amines dilate the arterioles either \\nby affecting or constructing the resistance vessels in non-vital organs. \\n \\nAdverse Reactions \\nRestlessness, headache, pallor, dizziness, precordial pain, and palpitation are the \\nadverse effects of therapeutic doses of sympathomime tic amines. As a result of \\noverdosage, convulsions, cerebral haemorrhage, and tachyarrhythmia resulting in \\nfatal ventricular arrhythmias are induced.  \\n \\nProlonged Administration of Vasoconstricting Sympathomimetic Amines:\\n \\nWhen these agents (especially, nor-adrenaline) are administered for a long time, \\na strong constriction of the post\\n-capillary sphincter occurs due to decreased \\nplasma volume. As a result, the capillary pressure is increased , leading to loss of \\nfluids through the capillary walls. Also, a decrease in renal blood flow and \\nglomerular filtration rate is seen. Thus, a conditio\\nn of \\nmarked tissue \\nhypoperfusion and irreversible shock usually results. \\n \\nProlonged Administration of Large Doses of Nor\\n-Adrenaline: When large \\ndoses of nor -adrenaline are administered for a long time, necrosis of the \\nintestines, liver and kidneys, haemorr\\nhage, focal myocarditis, intravascular \\nplatelet aggregation, and subepicardial haemorrhage occur. \\n \\nIf the  sympathomimetic amines are suddenly withdrawn after \\na prolonged \\ntherapy, recurrent and profound hypotension  occurs; thus, the therapy should be \\ndiscontinued gradually with appropriate fluid replacement. \\n \\nExamples of Drugs \\nNor-adrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, and the synthetic compounds \\nlike \\nisoprenaline, metaraminol, and dobutamine , are some of the sympathomimetic \\namines employed in the treatment of sh ock. Mephentermine, methoxamine, and \\nphenylephrine are the s\\nympathomimetic amines preferred as pressor agents \\nduring anaesthesia. Some of these drugs are discussed below: \\n1) Nor-Adrenaline: It increases the perfusion pressure and cardiac output in \\npatients with shock who have very low peripheral vascular resistance. Hence, \\nit is employed in patients suffering from low peripheral resistance shock.  \\n \\nHowever, it should not be administered in patients with shock syndrome, \\ncharacterised by high peripheral resistance and low or normal blood pressure. \\nThis is because \\nin such patients, nor\\n-adrenaline further induces \\nvasoconstriction, resulting in loss of plasma volume via capillaries and a \\nfurther worsening of kidney function. \\n2) Adrenaline: Administration of this drug  increases the cardiac output\\n, \\ndecreases the renal blood flow\\n, and increases t\\nhe Total Peripheral \\nResistance (TPR). Adrenaline is employed in the management of \\nanaphylactic shock.  \\n', 'link': []}, 68: {'text': '68 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n3) Dopamine: Renal and mesenteric blood flow is increased by this drug due to \\nits action on dopamine receptors. Dopamine causes stimulation of the heart \\nvia activation of β-receptors. It increases the cardiac output and renal blood \\nflow. It does not affect the TPR. It successfully treats oliguric patients having \\neither low or normal peripheral vascular resistance. \\nDopamine can also be \\ncombined with α-blocking agent in a vasoconstricted patient. It is used in the \\ntreatment of cardiogenic, septic and traumatic shock.  \\n4) Isoprenaline: It exerts its action by a \\nβ-adrenergic activity. It acts on the \\nheart and the periphery. It does not cause vasoconstriction in the kidneys \\n(unlike adrenaline). It is helpful in patients with shock who have a high \\nperipheral vascular resistance.   \\n5) Metaraminol: Its haemodynamic actions are similar to those of nor\\n-\\nadrenaline. However, its duration of action is longer than that of nor\\n-\\nadrenaline. \\n6) Dobutamine: It is a  newly synthesised synthetic catecholamine  that exerts \\nits actions by acting primarily on β1-receptors. It targets the cardiac β1-\\nreceptors, and thus its action on β2- and \\uf061-receptors are less pronounced. Its \\naction on \\uf061- and β2-receptors of blood vessels are not \\nmuch efficient, and \\nthus have comparatively fewer vascular effects.  \\n \\nDobutamine is employed in patients with severe CHF, and in those who have \\nundergone cardiac surgery as a short-term therapy. It increases the cardiac \\noutput as efficiently as is\\noprenaline. Its adverse effects\\n in the form of \\ntachycardia and arrhythmias are fewer as compared to those associated with \\nthe use of isoprenaline. \\n \\n2.1.2.2. \\nα-Adrenoceptor Blocking Agents \\nThe α-adrenoceptor blocking agents are used to reduce the intense vasoconstriction \\ncaused by the reflex release of nor -adrenaline (from the adrenergi c nerves) and \\ncatecholamines (from the adrenal medulla) as a result of shock. \\n  \\nAdvantages of α-adrenoceptor blocking agents are: \\n1) The harmful effect of vasoconstriction on microcirculation in tissues is avoided.\\n \\n2) Rapid administration of intravenous fluid is\\n enabled such that the central \\nvenous pressure is not increased. \\n3) The occult plasma volume deficit is unmasked. \\n \\nHowever, hypotension may be seen as an \\nadverse effect  of these agents,  \\nparticularly in patients with myocardial insufficiency. Therefore, therap\\ny \\nconstituting \\uf061-blockers should be followed by  adequate replacement of fluids. \\nThus, tissue perfusion is markedly improved. \\n \\nThe most commonly employed \\nα-adrenoceptor blocking agent is \\nphenoxybenzamine. It is a life -saving drug in patients with surgical shock or \\ntrauma. It causes an intense re-distribution of blood flow and plasma volume. For \\nthis effect, it needs to be administered intravenously in a dose of 1mg/kg of body \\n', 'link': []}, 69: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n69 \\n*  \\n* \\nweight diluted well in 500ml of glucose (5%). In 30 minutes , the complete effect \\nof the drug is seen. It has duration of action of several hours. It exerts its action in \\nthe form of a non-competitive inhibitor at the \\uf061-receptor. \\n \\nPhentolamine is another \\uf061-blocking agent having a shorter duration of action. \\nPressor drugs reverse  the effect of this drug because they competitively inhibit \\nthe action of phentolamine at the α-receptor. Either dopamine or nor-adrenaline \\nis simultaneously administered  along with the \\n\\uf061-blockers to counteract the \\nvasoconstriction produced. Any of these drugs do not affect the cardiac stimulant \\naction of the \\uf061-blockers.  \\n \\n2.1.2.3. \\nCorticosteroids \\nThe useful effects of corticosteroids in states of shock are not completely \\nunderstood. Their efficacy is also controversial. The sensitivity to endotoxin may \\nbe decreased when corticosteroids are  administered in cases of septic shock. \\nHowever, this increases the chances of infection, while increasing the probability \\nof bacteraemia. A high dose of corticosteroids are administered in a patient with \\nshock as they bring the following responses: \\n1) A positive inotropic effect, \\n2) Decreased peripheral resistance, \\n3) Stabilisation of lysosomes, \\n4) Preservation of integrity of small vessels, preventing leakage from \\nmicrocirculation, and \\n5) Decreased adhesiveness of the platelets.  \\n \\nIt is suggested that microcirculation is improv ed by all these effects that account \\nfor a combination of increase in cardiac output, vasodilatation and protection of \\ncells from the damaging effects of proteases (by lysosomal membrane \\nstabilisation). Although no suggestion relating to their advantageous\\n effects in \\npatients with shock has been reported. Yet, administration of corticosteroids in \\nlarge doses has been established to decrease the formation and liberation of \\ncardio-depressant elements from tissues due to their property of lysosomal \\nmembrane stabilisation. This property of corticosteroids also accounts for other \\ncellular effects that protect the cells from damage against hypoxia.  \\n \\n2.1.2.4. \\nOxygen \\nMaintenance of adequate oxygen exchange requires positive pressure ventilation. \\nAlso, the concentration of gases in blood should be monitored frequently to avoid \\ntoxicity of oxygen. \\n \\nAdvantages of supplemental oxygen in shock patients are: \\n1) Cardiac output is increased by the supplementation of oxygen, and \\n2) Oxygenation of the tissues can be improved significantly. \\n \\nSupplementation of oxygen in patients with shock is of immense importance in: \\n1) Conditions of arterial hypoxaemia (usually seen in cardiogenic shock), \\n2) Conditions of dyspnoea or cyanosis, and \\n3) When arterial PO2 falls below 60mm Hg. \\n', 'link': []}, 70: {'text': '70 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n2.1.2.5. \\nCardiac Glycosides \\nIn patients with Congestive Cardiac Failure (CCF) \\naccompanied with shock, \\ncardiac glycosides should be administered slowly in low doses to avoid th\\neir \\nperipheral vasoconstrictive action. Cardiac glycosides improve myocardial \\ncontractility, raise the cardiac output\\n, and improve tissue perfusion in \\nCCF \\npatients. In oliguric patients, the doses of cardiac glycosides \\nshould be more \\nreduced to avoid cumulative toxicity resulting from their accumulation. \\n \\n2.1.2.6. \\nGlucagon \\nMechanism of action of glucagon resembles  to that of sympathomimetic amines, \\nyet it is slightly different. It differs from the sympathomimetic\\n amines as its \\nactions are not blocked by β-blockers. \\n \\nAdvantages of administering glucagon are: \\n1) Increase in myocardial contractility and cardiac output, and \\n2) Intravenous administration of 1-2mg glucagon causes a definite improvement \\nin the hemodynamic status of patients with acute heart failure af ter a cardiac \\nsurgery and in patients of shock after myocardial infarction. \\n \\nAdverse effects of using glucagon in patients with shock: \\n1) Extreme nausea and vomiting (major effects), and  \\n2) Cardiac arrhythmias (rarely seen). \\n \\n2.1.2.7. \\nDextrans \\nDextrans are efficient plasma volume expanders. They are employed in the \\nemergency treatment of hypovolemic shock. However, they are not effective in \\nthe treatment of haemorrhagic shock as they do not replace blood (or its \\nderivatives). High molecular weight dextran  (mol. wt. 1,10,000) is employed \\nfor this purpose. It stays in the blood for a long time, thereby, maintaining the \\nosmotic pressure of blood.  \\n \\nCharacteristic features of low-molecular-weight dextran: \\n1) Available in mol. wt. of 40,000, also referred to as Dextran 40. \\n2) Available in the form of a 10% solution in either isotonic saline or 5% \\ndextrose in water. \\n3) Intravenous use is usually recommended. \\n4) Has a powerful yet temporary oncotic effect on blood. \\n5) Withdraws fluid into the vascular space, thus helps improve blood flow, \\n6) Possesses a property of decreasing the viscosity of blood by inducing a \\nnegative charge on the erythrocytes; thus the erythrocytes repel each other \\nand hence the microcirculation is improved. \\n7) Improves tissue perfusion and can thus be employed in patients with shock. \\n8) Prolongs bleeding time. \\n 9) May show anaphylactoid reactions. \\nHence, dextran 40 has been established to have only a limited use in the \\nmanagement of patients with shock. \\n', 'link': []}, 71: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n71 \\n*  \\n* \\n \\n2.2. DRUGS ACTING ON HAEMOPOIETIC \\nSYSTEM \\n \\n2.2.1. Introduction \\nThe word haemopoietic relates to the blood making processes . Hematologic \\nsystem includes the blood and blood -forming organs. The main function of the \\nblood is transportation of oxygen and nutrients required by the cells and \\nelimination of wastes from the body. It also transports hormones released by \\nthe endocrine system. White blood cells are also required in prevention of \\ninfection. \\n \\nThe blood is made up of two types of components, viz., plasma which is a straw-\\ncoloured liquid (around  55%) and the formed elements  (other 45%) which \\ninclude erythrocytes (red blood cells or RBCs), leukocytes (white blood cells or \\nWBCs), and platelets (clotting fragments). \\n \\n2.2.2. Hematinics \\nHematinics are involved in the formation of blood and  are used in the treatment \\nof anaemia  (a condition in which blood lacks healthy \\nRBCs or haemoglobin ). \\nHaemoglobin is a major part of the red blood cells to which oxygen molecules \\nget bound.  \\n \\nBody cells do not get sufficient amount of oxygen, if a n individual has a few or \\nabnormal red blood cells, or the haemoglobin level is low or abnormal. The main \\nsymptom of anaemia is \\nfatigue which occurs if  organs do not get sufficient \\namount of oxygen that is required for different body functions. \\n \\nAnaemia generally results from the deficiency of the following factors:  \\n1) Iron, \\n2) Folic acid, and \\n3) Vitamin B12. \\n \\n2.2.2.1. \\nIron \\nA healthy adult human body contains around 3.5g m of iron, of which about 2/3rd \\nis found in the blood, whereas the remaining portion is  preserved as ferritin and \\nhemosiderin in the bone marrow, spleen and muscles. The iron released by the \\ndestruction of red blood cells (around 3 × 10 6 RBCs are destroyed every second) \\nis re -utilised for the production of haemoglobin. The healthy human adul\\nt \\nrequires a diet containing around 10-15mg iron per day.  \\n \\nSources \\nMeat, chicken, egg yolk, liver, fish, oyster s, wheat germ, dry fruits, dry beans, \\nspinach, yeast, banana s, and apples are the rich sources  of iron; however, milk \\nand root vegetables have p\\noor amounts of  iron. The iron in meat protein is \\nhelpful in efficient absorption. Haemoglobin consists of \\nhaem iron and \\n', 'link': []}, 72: {'text': '72 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nmyoglobin which can be absorbed completely as haemin (ferric form of haem) \\nwithout being broken down \\ninto elemental iron. In other foods\\n, iron is less \\navailable for absorption because it is bound \\nto phytates or other complexing \\nagents. Non-haem iron and inorganic iron salts can be absorbed by intestinal \\nmucosal cells only after getting converted into ferrous iron. \\n \\nFerrokinetics \\nDepending on the physiological needs of the body, iron \\nis absorbed  in the \\nduodenum and proximal jejunum via active transport mechanism. Large doses of \\niron absorb by diffusion across the mucosal barrier. In foodstuffs, iron is mostly \\npresent in ferric form, which is reduced by the gastric acid to readily absorbable \\nferrous form. Due to this, achlorhydria reduces iron absorption, whereas ascorbic \\nacid (in high doses of 200mg in every 8 hour) being a reducing agent increases \\niron absorption. \\n \\nThe ferrous iron reaches the bloodstream directly by passing through the mucosal \\ncell. It is bound to transferrin in the blood and is carried to the storage sites. The \\nexcess ferrous iron in the mucosal cell is re-oxidised into the insoluble ferric state \\n(ferric hydroxide phosphate  complex), which  forms ferritin (a complex ) by \\ncombining with apoferritin (a protein). \\n \\nFerritin is a storage form of iron. A mucosal barrier is \\nformed when the \\nmucosal cell cannot take up iron due to the saturation of apoferritin with iron. \\nMost of these mucosal cells are desquamated and lost in the lumen of the gut. \\nTherefore, this mucosal barrier, called as \\nferritin curtain , controls iron \\nabsorption in the body. However, this mucosal barrier theory is still in question \\nby some workers. \\n \\nIron (Fe3+) is re leased by ferritin into the blood stream, where iron binds to \\ntransferrin (glycoprotein β1-globulin). The resultant complex is  carried to the \\nstorage depots (liver, spleen, \\nand bone marrow) and stored as ferritin\\n to be  \\nutilised for erythropoiesis. This iron is exchangeable, while the iron used  in the \\ncytochrome system is non -exchangeable. Trace amounts of iron are  excreted in \\nbile, urine, hair, nails , and sweat; however, its excessive quantities are excreted \\nin the skin and gut through desquamation of ferritin-containing cells. \\n \\nIron Therapy \\nIn case of iron -deficiency anaemia, approximately 25mg of iron is needed every \\nday for increasing haemoglobin by 1% per day. It is assumed that in oral therapy, \\nabout 30% of iron is absorbed , and therefore it is necessary to administer around \\n180mg of elemental iron every day.  \\n \\nThe following iron preparations are given to treat anaemic conditions:  \\n1) Oral Iron Preparations: It is the most common and preferred route for iron \\ntherapy. Dissociable ferrous salts have high iron content and can be absorbed \\nmore easily than ferric salts. Iron salts are mainly used i n tablet form as their \\nsolution forms stain the teeth. The following preparations and dosages are \\ngiven for the treatment of anaemia: \\n', 'link': []}, 73: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n73 \\n*  \\n* \\n \\n \\nSalt Taken \\nDose \\nFerrous sulphate, hydrated* \\n0.3g tid \\nFerrous sulphate, exsiccated \\n0.2g tid \\nFerric ammonium citrate \\n1.0g tid \\nReduced iron \\n0.5g tid \\nFerrous gluconate* \\n0.6g tid \\nFerrous fumarate* \\n0.2g tid \\nFerrocholinate \\n0.5g tid \\n(*most commonly used) \\n \\n \\nThe available slow release and chelated iron formulations cause less \\ngastrointestinal upsets and are better tolerated by children. High dose therapy \\nfor a long time leads to haemosiderosis. \\n2) Parenteral Iron Preparations: Generally oral iron therapy is enough to cure \\nanaemia and parenteral therapy is needed only in critical cases, such as:  \\ni) Intolerance to oral therapy, \\nii) Improper iron absorption from the intestines, \\niii) Malabsorption syndromes, \\niv) Inadequate response, or \\nv) Severe iron-deficiency anaemia. \\n \\nBefore the beginning of therapy\\n, the total dose to be administered \\nparenterally should be calculated (based on the haemoglobin level\\n) by the \\ngiven formula: \\n \\nTotal dose (mg) = 4.4 × Body wt. in kg × Haemoglobin deficit in g/100ml blood\\n \\n \\nThe following parenteral preparations of iron are commonly used: \\ni) Intramuscular Preparations: Iron dextran injection (Imferon) is the \\ncommonly used intra muscular preparation which contains 50mg/ml of \\nelemental iron. Daily 1 -4ml of this injection is administered through \\ndeep intramuscular route using Z -track technique  (a way of applying \\nintramuscular injection\\n that prevents\\n tracking or leakage of the \\nmedication into the subcutaneous tissue).  \\nii) Intravenous Preparations: Intravenous injections of iron are free of \\npreservatives. The first dose should be limited to 25mg, and \\nshould be \\ngradually increased to 100mg/day. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nIron therapy is mainly used in the treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia which results \\ndue to severe or chronic haemorrhage, malabsorption syndromes, simple \\nachlorhydria, malignancy, infection, nutritional deficiency, pregnancy, lactation, and \\nparasitic infestations (mainly ankylosto\\nmiasis). The iron\\n-deficiency anaemia \\nresponds to iron therapy quickly; however the given cause should also be treated \\nconcurrently. Even if the haemoglobin level becomes normal, the iron therapy should \\nbe continued for replenishing the exhausted stores of \\niron. As per the medical \\nexaminations, the haemoglobin reaches normal levels within 10 weeks \\nof oral \\ntherapy and 3-6 months of treatment is required for replenishment of the iron stores. \\n', 'link': []}, 74: {'text': '74 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nIron Toxicity  \\n1) Acute Toxicity: Excessive intake of iron salts lead t o acute toxicity. Adults \\ncan tolerate large doses without any fatality; however, doses of 1-2gm of iron \\ncan be fatal to young children. Therefore , these preparations should be kept \\nout of the reach of children.\\n The symptoms of acute poisoning include \\nabdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea followed by shock, lethargy, pallor, \\nand cyanosis. These signs and symptoms of acute toxicity appear within 30 \\nminutes or sometimes later. In case the patient survives for  6 hours, then it \\ncan be a passing period of recovery followed by death within 12-24 hours.  \\n \\nEmergency therapy is needed that includes gastric lavage with phosphate or \\ncarbonate solution to produce insoluble iron complexes. The iron chelating \\nagent, deferoxamine should be infuse d parenterally in the st omach so that it \\nbinds the iron in blood and improve the excretion. Supportive therapy is \\ngiven in case of shock, dehydration, and acid-base abnormalities.  \\n2) Chronic Toxicity: The condition, in which excessive iron is deposited in the \\nheart, liver, pancreas, and other organs , is known as haemochromatosis and \\nhaemosiderosis. This ultimately leads to organ failure and death. \\nHaemochromatosis is an inherited disorder in which absorption of iron increases \\nabnormally. For treating iron toxicity , deferoxamine is u sed but it is less \\nsatisfactory and costly; however, it may be used in conjunction with phlebotomy. \\n \\n2.2.2.2. \\nFolic Acid \\nFolic acid (or pteroylglutamic acid) belongs to the B complex group of vitamins \\nand its deficiency causes mega loblastic anaemia. Around 50 -100µg/day folic is \\nrequired by a healthy adult and about 200-400\\uf06dg/day is required in pregnancy  \\nand lactation. It is used in the treatment of macrocytic hyperchromic anaemia.  \\n \\nSources \\nYeast, green vegetables, and liver are the \\nrich sources of folic acid. The body \\nstores of folic acid are low; thus on stopping the intake of folic acid, the stores \\ndeplete and anaemia develops within 1-6 months.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nFolic acid is an inactive biochemical compound that changes to te\\ntrahydrofolic \\nacid and methyltetrahydrofolate in \\nthe presence of dihydrofolate reductase\\n \\nenzyme. These folic acid congeners are transported across\\n the cells through \\nreceptor-mediated endocytosis for regulation of erythropoiesis, synthesis of \\npurine and thymidylate nucleic acids, inter-conversion of amino acids, methylate \\ntRNA, and generation of formate. Folic acid can regulate the high homocysteine \\nlevels by re -methylation of homocysteine to methionine in the presence of \\nmethionine synthetase enzyme and using vitamin B12 as a cofactor. \\n \\nPharmacokinetics \\nThe polyglutamate form of 5CH 3-H4-folate, i.e., dietary folate, is hydrolysed by \\n\\uf061-glutamyl transferase enzyme in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa. The \\noxidation of active H 4-folate is prevented by a scorbic acid. The monoglutamate \\n', 'link': []}, 75: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n75 \\n*  \\n* \\nform of 5CH3-H4-folate is absorbed and transported while being bound to folate -\\nbinding plasma protein. It is stored in the liver (5 -20mg) and in some tissues (as \\npolyglutamates). Folic acid experiences enterohepatic circulat ion and is excreted \\nthrough urine and stool in trace amounts.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nFolic acid is mainly used in the treatment of megaloblastic anaemia occurring \\ndue to folate deficiency. Other than this it is also used to cure:  \\n1) Nutritional megaloblastic anaemia, \\n2) Megaloblastic anaemia of pregnancy, \\n3) Megaloblastic anaemia in infancy and childhood, \\n4) Megaloblastic anaemia associated with alcoholism and liver disease, \\n5) Chronic haemolytic states, \\n6) Megaloblastic anaemia of malignant disease, and \\n7) Some cases of agranulocytosis. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nAdverse effects are very rare in injectable and oral preparations. Large doses of \\nfolic acid may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenytoin and phenobarbital , \\nso fits may occur in a controlled patient.  \\n \\nFolate Deficiency \\nNormal plasma folate levels in a healthy adult human lie between 4-20ng/ml; and \\nits deficiency results due to nutritional deficiency, \\nsmall intestine diseases, \\nalcoholism, haemolytic anaemia, and some drugs. \\n \\nFolic acid is required in the following intracellular reactions: \\n1) Conversion of homocysteine to methionine, \\n2) Conversion of serine to glycine, \\n3) Synthesis of thymidylate, \\n4) Synthesis of purines, and \\n5) Metabolism of histidine. \\n \\nThese reactions are affected in cases of folic acid deficiency characterised by the \\ndevelopment of megaloblastic anaemia. Folate deficiency does not result \\nin \\nneurological irregularities. The effects of folate deficiency are observed early as \\nthe total body stores of folic acid are low.  \\n \\nThe symptoms of folate deficiency develop within 1 -4 weeks depending on the \\nindividual’s dietary habits and vitamin stores. Through measuring plasma folate \\nlevels and examining the peripheral blood smear , the deficiency of folate can be \\neasily diagnosed.  \\n \\nPreparations and Dosage \\nFolic acid is formulated in the form of tablets, either alone or with other vitamins. \\nTablets have 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, or 1mg of pteroylglutamic acid.  Folic acid injections \\nare formulated in aqueous solution of sodium salt of pteroylglutamic acid. The \\nintramuscular injections of Leucovorin calcium are also commercially available. \\n', 'link': []}, 76: {'text': '76 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n2.2.2.3. \\nVitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) \\nA wide range of both natural and semi -synthetic compounds are grouped in the \\ncobalamines family which include \\ncyanocobalamin (vitamin B\\n12) and \\nhydroxycobalamin (vitamin B12a).  Various other cobalamins are present, but they \\nare not as beneficial as vitamin B\\n12 and are also less stable . Vitamin B 12 is \\nprimarily used in the treatment of pernicious anaemia. \\n \\nSources \\nVitamin B12 is one of the most important vitamins. In humans, it is formed by the \\ncolonic bacteria (but is not absorbed)  and is excreted through faeces. Hence, the \\ndietary intake of vitamin B\\n12 is essential. In food, the cobalamins are found \\nbounded with protein and before absorption this bond is  broken by proteolysis.  \\nAround 0.6-1.2µg/day of vitamin B 12 is required and it is mainly stored in the \\nliver. Total vitamin B12 stored in the adults is around 5mg. It is naturally found in \\nanimal products, including fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nIn the body vitamin B12 is used in the following two forms: \\n1) Methylcobalamin: This form of vitamin B\\n12 is used as \\na cofactor by \\nmethionine synthase enzyme, which is involved in the conversion of \\nhomocysteine into methionine (required in DNA methylation ). In tissues , \\nvitamin B12 changes to coenzyme B 12 (methylcobalamin), which i s needed \\nfor the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and for the synthesis of \\nmethionine from homocysteine (a reaction in which folate is also r\\nequired). \\nVitamin B 12 also regulates sulfhydryl (S\\nH) groups in the reduced form \\nrequired by various SH-activated enzyme systems. \\n2) 5-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin: It acts as a cofactor for L -methylmalonyl-CoA \\nmutase enzyme, which changes L -methylmalonyl-CoA to suc cinyl-CoA. \\nThis conversion is essential for the extraction of energy from proteins and \\nfats. Succinyl CoA is also required for the production of haemoglobin. \\n \\nPharmacokinetics \\nFood contains vitamin B 12 as protein conjugates. Free vitamin B 12 is released in \\nthe stomach and duodenum by gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes. It\\n is also \\nreleased by cooking food. Intrinsic factor (a specific glycoprotein) is secreted by \\nthe parietal cells of stomach. This glycoprotein complexes with vitamin B\\n12 \\n(extrinsic factor) and gets absorbed in the distal ileum through a highly specific \\nreceptor-mediated transport mechanism. But if high doses (1mg) of vitamin B\\n12 \\nare given orally, a little amount is absorbed by diffusion even if the intrinsic \\nfactor is absent.  \\n \\nVitamin B12 is combined with transcobalamin (a specified plasma globulin) and \\ntransported into the blood. The liver (hepatic store 3\\n-5mg) stores the surplus \\nvitamin B 12; and this hepatic store lasts for 5 years if due to any reason the \\nabsorption of intestinal vitamin  B12 is stopped. Deficiency anaemia occurs only \\nwhen the hepatic store of vitamin B12 also gets exhausted. 3-7\\uf06dg of vitamin B12 is \\nexcreted in bile every day; however, most of it gets reabsorbed in enterohepatic \\n', 'link': []}, 77: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n77 \\n*  \\n* \\ncirculation. The excess amount of administered vitamin B12 remains free and does \\nnot bound to transcobalamin, thus gets excreted in urine. Since hydroxycobalamin is \\nmore protein-bound, it is better retained than cyanocobalamin. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\n1) Pernicious (Addisonian) Anaemia : The treatment may continue through \\nwhole life. \\n2) Malabsorption Syndromes: Deficiency of vitamin B12 and folic acid occurs \\nwith coeliac diseases, like sprue and idiopathic steatorrhoea; these conditions \\nin later stages result to megaloblastic anaemia.  \\n3) Neurological Conditions:  High doses (1mg or more) of vitamin B\\n12 are \\ngiven to the patients of trigeminal neuralgia, toxic/diabetic/alcoholic neuritis, \\nand other nutritional neuropathies. High doses of vitamin B\\n12 are used in \\nneuroblastoma in children. \\n4) Psychiatric Disorders: This is an old age disorder which may favourably \\nrespond to vitamin B12 therapy. \\n \\nDeficiency Diseases  \\nVitamin B12 deficiency arises either due to its malabsorption from distal ileum or \\ndue to absence of the intrinsic factor (in cases o\\nf pernicious anaemia and \\ngastrectomy). The cause of vitamin B\\n12 deficiency is not the lack of its dietary \\nsupply because the daily requirement is only 2 \\uf06dg and the daily diet contains 5 -\\n40\\uf06dg of vitamin B 12.Vitamin B12 deficiency results in the following disorders of \\nhaematopoietic and nervous system: \\n1) Megaloblastic Anaemia and Pernicious Anaemia: \\nIn megaloblastic \\nanaemia, very large-sized RBCs are formed. It causes hypercellular marrow \\ndue to abnormal maturation and defective DNA synthesis.\\n Pernicious \\nanaemia is a type of megaloblastic anaemia which occurs due to vitamin B12 \\ndeficiency in the absence o f castle intrinsic factor  (secreted by the normal \\ngastric mucosa). This intrinsic factor is required for the intestinal absorption \\nof the extrinsic factor, i.e., dietary vitamin B12.  \\n \\nVitamin B 12 deficiency mainly occurs due to ineffective haemopoiesis \\n(maturation arrest at the megaloblastic stage) , inadequate epithelial cells of \\nthe gut (histamine-fast achlorhydria and achylia gastric a), inadequate myelin \\nsynthesis (sub -acute combined degeneration of the dorsal columns of the \\nspinal cord) and general debility. \\n2) Neurological Disorders: Neurological symptoms of vitamin B 12 deficiency \\nare paraesthesias of hand and feet, reduction on the sensation of vibration and \\nposition, reduced deep tendon reflexes, memory loss, confusion, delusion, \\nloss of central vision, hallucination, and psychosis.  \\n \\nPreparations and Dosage \\nVitamin B 12 is available as tablet s, syrup s, and injectable s along with other \\nvitamins. Cyanocobalamin  injections are available as red coloured aqueous \\nsolutions of various concentrations. They are given through IM or SC route.\\n \\n', 'link': []}, 78: {'text': '78 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nHowever, some patients show reduction in plasma concentration of B12 within 30 \\ndays of injection and  the development of antibodies\\n against transcobalamin \\nvitamin B12 complex is also seen; therefore, hydroxycobalamin is not suggested. \\n \\n2.2.3.  Coagulants  \\nCoagulants are agents that help in the coagulation of blood and are given in \\nhaemorrhagic conditions. The elements or factors required for coagulation are found \\nin the fresh whole blood or plasma, and are therefore indicated in case of deficiency \\nof any clotting factor.

Whole blood o r plasma is best for the immediate \\neffects as it provides all the endogenous coagulation factors along with plasma \\nvolume replenishment. Vitamin K is fat -soluble vitamin which takes part in the \\nsynthesis of clotting factors. \\n \\nSources \\nGreen leafy vegetables , liver, cheese, butter, and egg yolk are good sources of \\nvitamin K. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nVitamin K is required for the synthesis of various factors II, VII, IX, and X that \\ntake part in blood coagulation reaction. Chemically, these factors are \\nglycoproteins with a number (10 or 11) or \\uf067-carboxyglutamic acid at the ─NH2 \\nterminal of the peptide chains. Vitamin K\\n-regulated synthesis of \\n\\uf067-\\ncarboxyglutamic acid residues occurs after the peptide chain synthesis. In the \\ncarboxylation reaction, vitamin K acts as a co-factor.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFactor II, VII, IX, and X \\n(Decarboxylated form) \\nII, VII, IX, and X  \\n(\\uf067-carboxylated form) \\nVit K (hydroquinone \\nform or reduced form) \\nVit K (epoxide form or \\noxidised form) \\n', 'link': []}, 79: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n79 \\n*  \\n* \\nTherapeutic Uses \\n1) Prolonged Antimicrobial Therapy: Antimicrobial therapy for a long period \\ncauses destruction of GIT bacteria , thus formation of vitamin K is either \\nreduced or stopped. For the treatment of this condition\\n, vitamin K \\npreparations are given through oral route. \\n2) Obstructive Jaundice: It is caused by malabsorption of dietary or intestinal \\nvitamin K. Vitamin K 3 can be administered orally, while K1 or K 2 can be \\ngiven through parenteral route. \\n3) Overdosage of Oral Anticoagulants:  In this case, vitamin K is given as \\nspecific antidote. Vitamin K\\n1 is the preparation of choice due to its rapid \\nonset of action. Menadiol sodium diphosphate (K3) should not be used due to \\nits late onset of action (24 hours). \\n4) Malabsorption Syndrome: In this condition, parenteral vitamin K or \\noral \\nvitamin K3 may be used. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nAdverse effects are very rare in oral administration. However, in some patients \\nserious anaphylactoid reactions may occur  after IV administration. Large doses \\nof synthetic menadione may cause haemolytic anaemia , hyperbilirubinemia and \\nkernicterus in new-borns, mainly in premature infants. \\n \\nPreparations \\n1) Phytomenadione (Phytonadione, Vitamin K\\n1): It is a naturally found \\nvitamin and works within 12 hours. It can be given through IV, IM, SC , and \\noral routes. It should be given slowly in case of intravenous administration as \\nflushing, sweating, chest tightness, and peripheral vascu\\nlar collapse may \\noccur due to the presence of castor oil in the preparation. \\n2) Menadione Sodium Diphosphate (Vitamin K\\n3): It is a  water-soluble, \\nsynthetic analogue of vitamin K given daily in 5 -40mg dose by IV, IM, and \\noral route. The major drawback of this preparation is that it takes 24 hours to \\nwork, whereas its action lasts for days.  \\n \\n2.2.3.3. \\nOther Drugs \\nFollowing are the examples of drugs used as coagulants:  \\n1) Fibrinogen: It is the soluble component of human plasma. On addition of \\nthrombin, it transforms to fibrin. It regulates the haemorrhage related to low \\nblood fibrinogen concentration in afibrinogenaemia or hypofibrinogenaemia; \\nhowever, the plasma or cryoprecipitate is used. It is also used in disseminated \\nintravascular coagulation (the defibrination syndrome). \\n2) Antihaemophilic Factor: It is a sterile freeze -dried powder having factor \\nVIII fraction obtained from human plasma from whole blood don\\nors. It is \\nused in patients of haemophilia (a genetic disorder of factor VIII deficiency), \\nwho are susceptible to bleeding.  \\n3) Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid (EACA): It is an anti -fibrinolytic that acts by \\npreventing activation of plasminogen and \\nplasmin ( to a sm aller degree ). \\n', 'link': []}, 80: {'text': '80 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nEACA prevents the lysis of existing clot and results in thrombosis. It is used \\nin haemorrhage with extreme fibrinolysis, such as overdose of streptokinase, \\nurokinase (UK), and \\nalteplase. It is clinically used in the treatment of \\nhaemorrhagic conditions occurring due to some surgery or obstetric \\ncomplications, especially in patients of menorrhagia or haematuria in \\nneoplasms like metastatic carcinoma of the prostate and leukaemia. Initially, \\n5gm of oral dose is given followed by 1gm hourly to a maximum of 25-30gm \\nin 24 hours until bleeding stops. \\n4) Thrombin: It is an enzymatic preparation. It changes fibrinogen to fibrin. A \\nsolution of human or bovine thrombin is used locally as a haemostatic. \\nTopically, it controls the haemorrhage from puncture sites or capillary oozing \\nduring surgery.  \\n5) Fibrin Foam:  It is extracted, dried, and artificial foam, f\\normulated in the \\nform of strips,  cut in any size and used for local haemostasis. It is used in \\nsurgery along with thrombin. Fibrin foam dipped in thrombin \\nis kept at the \\nbleeding site and can be left in place as the clotting material of human origin. \\n6) Snake Venoms: Venom of the Russell’s viper and copper head snake is used \\nas coagulant\\ns. The venom increases coagulation by activating \\nthrombokinase. It can be used systemically or locally. \\n7) Oxidised Cellulose (Oxycel): It is a dry absorbable surgical gauze. It is used \\nin haemostasis and helps in clotting by reaction between haemo\\nglobin and \\ncellulosic acid. If used on bleeding surface\\n, it swells to form a gelatino us \\nmass which get s absorbed in 2 -7 days. When haemostasis occurs, it should \\nbe removed. It should be used in moderate bleeding where suturing or \\nligation is impractical. \\n \\n2.2.4. Anticoagulants \\nAnticoagulants are a gents decreasing the coagul ation ability of blood. They do \\nnot dissolve the already formed clots, but are used to inhibit the formation of new \\nclots. Examples of these agents are heparin and warfarin. Heparin is given \\nintravenously to patients at risk of \\nthrombus formation and warfa\\nrin is \\nadministered orally. \\n \\n2.2.4.1. \\nClassification  \\nAnticoagulants are used to decrease blood coagulability. They are classified as follows: \\n1) Injectable Anticoagulants: Heparin, Ancrod, and Lepirudin. \\n2) Oral Anticoagulants \\ni) \\nCoumarin Derivatives: Bishydroxycoumarin ( Dicumarol), Warfarin \\nsodium, Acenocoumarin, and Ethylbiscoumacetate. \\nii) Indandione Derivative: Phenindione. \\n \\n2.2.4.2. \\nInjectable Anticoagulants - Heparin \\nHeparin is a strong anticoagulant agent which is naturally found\\n in human \\nblood cells (mainly in basophils or mast cells). It is synthesised in the liver and \\nlungs of domestic animals.  It is synthetically available as heparin sodium and \\n', 'link': []}, 81: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n81 \\n*  \\n* \\nthe low - and high -molecular weight heparins (fractionated heparins). It is a \\npotent organic acid and commercially obtained from bovine lung and porcine \\nintestinal mucosa. \\n \\nMechanism of Action (Figure 2.1) \\nHeparin binds and potentiates the activity of plasma antithrombin\\n-III, which \\nforms stable complexes with the activated clotting facto\\nrs (Xa, IIa, IXa, Xia, \\nXIIa, and XIIIa) to prevent them. In low concentrations, heparin selectively \\nprevents the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Hence, heparin inhibits \\nthrombus formation; however it does not have thrombolytic action. It has \\nantiplatelet action in high doses\\n, and hence increase the bleeding time. It \\ndecreases the blood lipid level by releasing lipoprotein lipase from vessel wall \\nand tissues. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPharmacokinetics \\nHeparin is given parenterally through intravenous or subcut aneous route because \\nit is absorbed orally. It does not cross the placenta. It is metabolised in the liver \\nand follows first-order kinetics. The IV injection of less than 100 units per kg has \\nthe half-life of average one hour; however beyond this dose, it \\nbecomes dose-\\ndependent and half -life increases to 5 hours. The half\\n-life also increases in \\npatients with hepatic cirrhosis, and decreases in patients with pulmonary \\nembolism. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nHeparin is an anticoagulant and is used in the treatment of var\\nious pathological \\nconditions like unstable angina, dialysis, pulmonary embolism, arterial or venous \\nthrombosis, and angioplasty. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\n1) Heparin shows allergic reactions with fever, urticaria, and anaphylactic shock\\n. \\n2) Transient and mild thrombocytopenia may occur in 2-5% patients because of \\nheparin-induced platelet aggregation. After 7-14 days, severe thrombocytopenia \\nis seen because of formation of heparin -dependent platelet antibodies . This \\ncondition is recovered by replacing heparin with oral anticoagulants. \\nFigure 2.1: Coagulation Cascade.

LMWHs have an average molecular weight of less than 8000Da. \\nThey contain short chains of polysaccharide  and 60% of all chains are having \\nmolecular weight less than 8000Da.  LMWHs are known as heparin salts. They \\nare formed by using various methods such as fractionation or depolymerisation \\nof polymeric heparin. They possess a potency of greater than 70 units/mg of anti-\\nfactor Xa and a ratio of anti-factor Xa activity to anti-thrombin activity of > 1.5. \\n \\nLMWHs have following characteristic features over the heparin: \\n1) They have a higher bioavailability on subcutaneous administration. \\n2) They have a longer half-life. \\n3) They are less bound to plasma proteins. \\n4) They do not require frequent monitoring of partial thromboplastin time. \\n5) They undergo weaker interactions with platelets. \\n 6) They rarely cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.   \\nDue to their high molecular weight, the high molecular weight heparins do not \\ncross the placenta of human easily, thus are not used anymore. \\n \\n2.2.4.3. \\nOral Anticoagulants \\nOral anticoagulants are the antagonists of vitamin K that prevent th\\ne γ-\\ncarboxylation of glutamic acid resi dues at many locations at the amino terminal \\nand of coagulation factors. The fir\\nst used oral anticoagulant was \\nbishydroxycoumarin, and later several other congeners were synthesised that are \\ntermed as coumarin derivatives. \\n \\n2.2.4.4. \\nCoumarin Derivatives \\nCoumarin derivatives show anticoagulant activity only in vivo (and not in vitro) \\nas they indirectly inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K -dependent clotting factors in \\nthe liver. They decrease the availability of vitamin K and results in its deficiency. \\n \\nSome examples of coumarin derivatives are:  \\n1) Bishydroxycoumarin: It has a half-life of 24-100 hours.  \\n2) Warfarin Sodium: It has a half-life of 36-44 hours and its duration of action \\nis 4 -7 days with a loading dose of 10\\n-15mg followed by 1\\n-10mg/day \\nmaintenance dose. The clinically used warfarin is a racemic mixture of equal \\namounts of the R - and S -enantiomers. The levorotatory S -warfarin is four \\ntimes more effective than dextrorotatory R-warfarin.  \\n3) Acenocoumarin: It is used in a loading dose of 10\\n-20mg followed by a \\nmaintenance dose of 2 -10mg. It can cause oral ulceration, GIT disturbances, \\nand dermatitis. \\n', 'link': []}, 83: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n83 \\n*  \\n* \\nMechanism of Action (Figure 2.2) \\nCoumarin derivatives act as the competitive antagonist of vitamin K. They inhibit \\nthe synthesis of factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, X, and protein C and S. For \\nthese coagulation factors, \\nγ-carboxylation is essential. \\nCoumarin derivatives \\nprevent the regeneration of vitamin K from its epoxide derivatives in vitro, thus \\ncauses vitamin K deficiency.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThey inhibit the regeneration of active vitamin K-hydroquinone (reduced form of \\nvitamin K). This reduced vitamin K is oxidised to vitamin K epoxide (inactive \\nform). This reaction is coupled with protein carboxylation by which Des Carboxy \\nProthrombin (DCP) is converted to prothrombin by carboxylation of glutamate \\nresidue. By the reactions of enzyme, vitamin K hydroquinone is regenerated from \\nvitamin K -epoxide, using NADH as a co\\n-factor. Synthesis of clotting factors \\nreduces in 2 -4 hours and the effect of anticoagulant lasts for 1\\n-3 days, if the \\nsynthesis of clotting factors decreases by 40-50%. \\n \\nPharmacokinetics \\nCoumarin derivatives are well-absorbed when given through oral, intramuscular, \\nand rectal route. Peak plasma level is obtained within 2\\n-8 hours after oral \\nadministration. They are 90 -99% bound to plasma protein, mainly albumin. \\nSensitivity towards anticoagulants differs from patient to patient, therefore \\nindividual dose adjustment is required. Adjustments of dose are done to retain the \\nprothrombin time between 1.5 -2 times and an international normalised ratio \\n(INR) of 2 to 3 times of control. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nWarfarin is used as  an anticoagulant in patients of pulmonary embolism, deep \\nvein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation, to inhibit thromboembolism, prosthetic valves, \\nprimary pulmonary hypertension, and sometime in cerebrovascular disease. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe most severe risk factor with oral anticoagulant therapy is haemorrhage in any \\norgan which further results in haematomas and anaemia. Alopecia, fever, nausea, \\nvomiting, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity reaction, priapism, and skin reactions are \\nsome other side effects. \\nFigure 2.2: Mechanism of Action of Oral Anticoagulants \\nDescarboxyprothrombin \\n(and factor VII, IX, and X) \\nProthrombin  \\n(and factor VII, IX, and X) \\nVit K-hydroquinone \\n(Reduced and active form) \\nVit K-epoxide  \\n(Oxidised and inactive form) \\nEpoxide reductase (oral anticoagulants \\ninhibit epoxide reductase) \\nNAD+ \\nNADH \\nO2 CO2 \\n', 'link': []}, 84: {'text': '84 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nDuring pregnancy warfarin causes teratogenicity. When given in the first \\ntrimester, it can cause foetal warfarin syndrome with bone stippling, and \\nabnormalities of face and CNS. It causes neonatal hypoprothrombinaemia in the \\nsecond and third trimester. Patients with bleeding should not be given warfarin. \\nIn patients with haemorrhagic blood disorders, peptic ulcers, severe wounds, and \\nbacterial endocarditis, warfarin should be used very carefully.  \\n \\n2.2.4.5. \\nIndandione Derivative - Phenindione \\nPhenindione acts as an anticoagulant and shows actions similar to warfarin. It is \\nnow used rarely due to higher cases of severe adverse effects.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nPhenindione acts by inhibiting \\nvitamin K reductase  enzyme, which causes \\ndepletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH 2). Vitamin K ac ts as a \\ncofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate remains on the N -terminal regions of \\nvitamin K-dependent proteins, therefore reduced level of vitamin K limits the γ-\\ncarboxylation and subsequent activation of vitamin K\\n-dependent coagulant \\nproteins. Phenindione prevents the formation of vitamin K\\n-dependent \\ncoagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X ) and anticoagulant proteins (C and S ). \\nDepression of the three vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, and X) \\ncauses reduction in the \\nprothrombin levels and in the amount of thrombin \\ngenerated and bound to fibrin. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nPhenindione is used for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, \\natrial fibrillation and flutter, cerebral embolism, mural thrombosis, and \\nthrombophilia. It is also used for anticoagulant prophylaxis. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nPhenindione gives rise to r\\neddish purple swollen patches on skin,\\n feeling of \\nsickness, red or brown coloured urine,\\n severe stomach pain or back pain,\\n \\ndifficulty in breathing, chest pain, numbness, black or red stools, consciousness, \\nslurred speech, and bleeding cuts or wounds. \\n \\n2.2.5. Fibrinolytics  \\nFibrinolytics are used for dissolving the blood clots (or thrombi). Blood clotting \\ncan occur in any vascular bed ; but they can be life threate ning, if they occur in \\ncoronary, cerebral or pulmonary vessels. Myocardial infarctions are caused by \\ncoronary thrombi, strokes are produced by cerebrovascular thrombi\\n, and \\npulmonary thromboemboli can cause respiratory and cardiac failure. Therefore, \\nblood clots should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.  \\n \\n2.2.5.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nBlood coagulation and thrombus formation are significant for haemostasis; but, \\nto check bleeding it should be restricted to a smallest area. Two endogenous \\nmechanisms, i.e., fibrin inhibition and fibrinolysis, restrict the extension of thrombus\\n \\nformation. Some endogenous clotting factor protease inhibitors (\\uf0611-antitrypsin, \\uf0612-\\nmacroglobulin, \\uf0612-antiplasmin, and antithrombin III) affect the inhibition of fibrin\\n. \\n', 'link': []}, 85: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n85 \\n*  \\n* \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe main process of fibrinolysis involves the conversion of inactive plasminogen \\n(bound to the fibrin of thrombus) to the active proteolytic enzyme plasmin. \\nFactor XIIIa activates the plasminogen at the beginning of coagulation. The \\nformation of tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) from the kidneys is initiated by \\nthrombus formation. The active plasmin formed from the fibrin\\n-bound \\nplasminogen re -modifies the thrombus, and restricts its extension by breaking \\ndown fibrin into fragments  (figure 2.3). Fibrinolytic mechanism is not affected \\nby heparin and oral anticoagulants.  \\n \\n2.2.5.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThrombolytic drugs were initially used for treating deep vein thrombosis\\n and \\nserious pulmonary embolism; but now, they are used less frequently. Their use in \\nthe treatment of acute myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial thrombosis is \\nalso restricted because they have a tendency to cause bleeding. However, \\nthrombolytic agents dissolve  clots by causing occlusions, thus help in restoring \\ncatheter and shunt function. They are also used for dissolving the clots resulting \\nin strokes.  \\n \\n2.2.5.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe fibrin of an unwanted thrombus and the fibrin of a beneficial haemostatic \\nplug are not discriminat\\ned by the thrombolytic agents, t\\nhus, resulting in \\nhaemorrhage; this is t\\nhe m ajor side effect. \\nFor example, \\na previously \\nunsuspected peptic ulcer\\n may haemorrhage after a thrombolytic agent\\n is \\ninjected. \\n \\nThrombolytic agents are \\ncontraindicated in  pregnancy, head trauma, brain \\ntumour, metastatic cancer, intracranial bleeding, and\\n in patients with healing \\nwounds or hist ory of cerebrovascular accident .

In low doses, it lyses fibrin without \\ndegrading other proteins ( especially, fibrinogen). Alteplase is used for \\ntreating myocardial infarction, massive pulmonary embolism, a\\nnd acute \\nischemic stroke. Bleeding complications like GI and cerebral haemorrhages \\nare the adverse effects of alteplase. \\n2) Streptokinase: It is an  extracellular protein purified from culture broths of \\ngroup C \\uf062-haemolytic Streptococci. The half-life of streptokinase is less than \\n30 minutes. Therapy with this drug is started within 4 hours of myocardial \\ninfarction and is infused for an hour. Thromboplastin time is monitored and \\nmaintained at 2\\n-5 times the control value. Either heparin or oral \\nanticoagulants may be administered on discontinuation of streptokinase.  \\n \\nStreptokinase has no enzymatic activity, but it forms an active complex with \\nplasminogen. This complex converts the uncomplexed plasminogen to the \\nactive enzyme plasmin. Streptokinase hydrolyses fibrin, plugs this complex, \\nand also catalyses degradation of fibrinogen and clotting factors V and VII.  \\nStreptokinase is used \\nin acute pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial \\ninfarction, occluded access shunts, deep vein thrombosis, and arterial \\nthrombosis. The adverse effects of streptokinase are: \\ni) Bleeding Disorders: \\nSince streptokinase activates the \\ncirculating \\nplasminogen, the p lasmin levels are \\nraised. This  may dissolve the \\nhaemostatic plugs and precipitate bleeding. Aminocaproic acid may be \\nadministered in rare cases of life threatening haemorrhage. \\nii) Hypersensitivity: Streptokinase is a foreign protein \\nthat gives rise to  \\nrashes, fever, and anaphylaxis. This is because as most individuals have \\nalready suffered from streptococcal infection, \\nantibodies against \\nstreptokinase are present in their blood . These antibodies neutralise the \\nfibrinolytic properties of streptokinase by combining with it. \\nTo \\novercome \\nthe antibodies and provide a therapeutic \\nplasmin \\nconcentration, streptokinase should be administered in adequate doses. \\nThe presence of anti -streptococcal antibodies may cause fever, allergic \\nreactions, and therapeutic failure of streptokinase. \\n3) Urokinase: It is a low molecular weight human urokinase which has an A \\nchain (of 2,000 Daltons ) joined to a B chain \\n(of 30,400 Daltons ) by a \\nsulphydryl bond. It is a recombinant urokinase plasminogen activator.\\n \\nUrokinase acts on the endogenous fibrinolytic system by producing active \\n', 'link': []}, 87: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n87 \\n*  \\n* \\nplasmin through cleaving the Arg\\n-Val bond in plasminogen. \\nThe formed \\nplasmin degrades the fi brin clots, fibrinogen, and other plasma proteins.  \\nUrokinase is a non-antigenic enzyme which was earlier isolated from human \\nurine, but now is obtained from cultured human kidney cells. It directly \\nactivates plasminogen and has a plasma \\nhalf-life of 10 -15 minutes. It is \\nprescribed to patients who have used streptokinase in an earlier episode. \\nHypotension and allergic reactions occur rarely but fever occurs commonly \\nduring the treatment with urokinase.  \\n \\n2.2.6.  Anti-Platelet Drugs \\nAnti-platelet or anti -thrombotic drugs affect  platelet plug formation and are \\nmainly used for preventing arterial thromboembolism. \\nCombination of anti-platelet drugs produces additive or synergistic effect. These \\nproperties are used for preventing restenosis af\\nter coronary angioplasty and \\ncoronary stenting. \\n \\n2.2.6.1. \\nClassification \\nAnti-platelet drugs based on their mechanism of action are classified as follows: \\n1) Prostaglandin Synthesis (PG) Inhibitors: Aspirin and Dazoxiben. \\n2) Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Dipyridamole. \\n3) ADP-Induced Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors: \\nTiclopidine and\\n \\nClopidogrel. \\n4) Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor Inhibitors: Tirofiban and Eptifibatide. \\n \\n2.2.6.2. \\nProstaglandin Synthesis (PG) Inhibitors \\nSome common PG inhibitors are discussed below: \\n1) Aspirin: In low doses (75\\n-300mg/day), it is  used as a prophylaxis of \\nmyocardial infarction and also as a prophylaxis against secondary myocardial \\ninfarction. Aspirin acts through irreversible acetylation of plat\\nelet \\ncyclooxygenase. In low doses, it produces a  nominal and transient effect on \\nvascular cyclooxygenase. It has been proved that aspirin in low doses \\nreduces the occurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and re -infarction; \\nhowever, t he overall mortali ty rate is left  unaffected. Scientifically, low \\ndoses of aspirin can be used for long\\n-term prevention of  myocardial \\ninfarction. Its effects can be improved by using it along with dipyridamole.  \\n2) Dazoxiben: It is \\na thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, \\nthus sele ctively \\ndecreases TxA 2. It does not inhibit platelet aggregation  when given alone; \\nhowever, with aspirin it produces considerable effects.  \\n3) Epoprostenol (PGI2): It is a potent inh ibitor of platelet aggregation; but its \\nuse has been prohibited due to its very short half-life. It may be used during \\nrenal dialysis or cardiac bypass surgery.  \\n4) Sulphinpyrazone: It is a uricosuric drug and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. It \\nis not selective for platelets. \\nEarlier it was used in low doses to prevent \\nmyocardial re -infarction (like aspirin) , but after multi-centric long -term \\ntrials, it has been withdrawn.  \\n', 'link': []}, 88: {'text': '88 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n5) Diet: Dietary therapy can be adjunctive in the prophylaxis of thrombosis. \\nThe Eskimos intake high amounts of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (an \\nunsaturated fatty acid) , thus they generate  PGI3 that is an anti-aggregating \\nsubstance like PGI2. \\n \\n2.2.6.3. \\nPhosphodiesterase Inhibitors \\nPhosphodiesterase inhibitors inhibit\\n platelet function by inhibiting \\ncGMP \\nphosphodiesterase activity and/or adenosine uptake. It is never used alone  due to \\nits minimal antiplatelet action, thus is used along with aspirin to enhance the\\n \\nantiplatelet action.  In secondary prophylaxis of cerebrovascular diseases, \\ndipyridamole is used along with aspirin. Dipyridamole with warfarin is used after \\nprosthetic heart valve surgery for primary prophylaxis of thromboembolism. \\n \\n2.2.6.4. \\nADP-Induced Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors \\nThe commonly used drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation are discussed below: \\n1) Dipyridamole: It inhibits phosphodiesterase for increasing platelet cAMP. It \\ncan also release PG precursors from vascular endothelium. It is a vasodilator \\nand can inhibit platelet adhesion to thr\\nombogenic surfaces. It can be used \\nalong with low-dose aspirin. \\n2) Timolol: It is a β-adrenoceptor blocker, and its concurrent use synergises the \\naction of low -dose aspirin. It is used for long -term prevention of secondary \\nmyocardial infarction. \\n3) Clopidogrel and Ticlopidine:  These drugs inhibit the ADP pathway of \\nthrombocytes, and thus reduce platelet aggregation. The binding of ADP to \\nits receptors is inhibited irreversibly by these drugs. They do \\nnot inhibit \\nprostaglandin synthesis. Clinically, they are used for treating unstable angina \\npectoris, acute coronary syndrome, acute neurovascul ar disease, peripheral \\nvascular disease, and for preventing thrombosis coronary surgery. The dose \\nof ticlopidine is 250mg twice daily via oral route , and that of clopidogrel is \\n75mg/day, with a subsequent loading dose of 300mg via oral route . Nearly \\n80% pl atelet activity is inhibited by these doses. Gastrointestinal adverse \\neffects, leucopenia, and haemorrhage  are the adverse effects of ticlopidine , \\nwhereas clopidogrel may cause haemorrhage. Because of less adverse effects \\nand the dosage factor, clopidogrel is preferred over ticlopidine. \\n4) Clofibrate: It is a hypolipidaemic drug which may be used for reducing \\nplatelet adhesiveness. It does not prevent secondary myocardial infarction. \\n5) Dextran-70 and Dextran-75: These are plasma volume expanders given as \\nIV infusions. They have no effect on platelet function in vitro, but damages \\nplatelet function and fibrin polymerisation in vivo. Postoperatively, they are \\nused for preventing venous thrombosis. \\n \\n2.2.6.5. \\nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor Inhibitors \\nGlycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors are integrin or platelet surface adhesive  \\nreceptors. The receptor complex binds fibronectin and Von Willebrand factor, \\nand also functions as a receptor for fibrinogen \\nand vitronectin. The receptor \\n', 'link': []}, 89: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n89 \\n*  \\n* \\ncomplex on activation mediates platelet aggregation by helping the platelets to \\nbind to the exposed collagen and also to the adjacent platelet. The effect of other \\nplatelet agonist s (e.g., collagen, thrombin, TXA 2, ADP, etc. ) is inhibited by \\nGPIIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors. They also inhibit the final common pathway for \\nplatelet aggregation. \\n \\nGPIIb/IIIa receptors including vitronectin receptor are blocked by abciximab (a \\nhumanised monoclonal antibody\\n). Eptifibatide and Tirofiban (chemical \\nanalogues of fibrinogen)  block fibrinogen binding. These drugs are parenterally \\nadministered as a short course therapy in percutaneous coronary intervention and \\nacute coronary syndrome. \\n \\n2.2.6.6. \\nMechanism of Action \\nAntiplatelet agents affect various pla telet functions, such as aggregation, release \\nof granule contents, and platelet-mediated vascular constriction. The mechanisms \\nof action of different classes of anti-platelets are given below: \\n1) Class I:  Irreversible cyclooxygenase ( or prostaglandin H syntha se) is  the \\nenzyme mediating the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane \\nbiosynthesis from arachidonic acid. This enzyme is blocked by as pirin and \\nrelated compounds (NSAIDs and sulfinpyrazone). \\n2) Class II:\\n \\nDipyridamole inhibits \\ncAMP \\nbreakdown mediated by \\nphosphodiesterase, thus prevents platelet activation by multiple mechanisms. \\n3) Class III: Ticlopidine and clopidogrel block  the binding of ADP to a low -\\naffinity, type -2 purinergic receptor and prevent  the activation of GPII b/IIIa \\nreceptor complex, thus subsequent aggregation. \\n4) Class IV: The final common pathway of platelet aggregation is inhibited by \\nanti-IIb/IIIa antibodies (abciximab) and receptor antagonists (tirofiban and  \\neptifibatide). They may also prevent the initial adhesion to the vessel wall. \\n \\n2.2.6.7. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nAnti-platelet drugs prevent arterial thromboembolism in the following situations: \\n1) Coronary Artery Diseases \\ni) Unstable Angina: The risk of death and myocardial infarction is reduced \\nby aspirin in \\n75-325mg/day dose . However, aspirin along with\\n \\nclopidogrel (75mg/day) is preferred. Abciximab via intravenous route \\ndue to its rapid action is used as a short\\n-term therapy for the same \\npurpose. Maintenance therapy is given for an indefinite period by oral \\naspirin or clopidogrel in 75mg/day dose. \\nii) Acute Myoc ardial Infarction:  Survival (30% reduction in mortality) \\nand thrombolytic therapy is improved by oral aspirin in 325mg  dose (1 \\ntablet) followed by a maintenance dose of 75mg/day. \\niii) Post MI Patients:  Aspirin in 75mg/day dose  is administered for an \\nundefined period as a secondary prophylactic agent for reducing the risk \\nof infarction by 25%. \\nA suitable alternative can be \\nClopidogrel \\nadministered in the same dose orally.  \\n', 'link': []}, 90: {'text': '90 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Cerebrovascular Diseases:  Aspirin in 75-325mg/day dose is used as a \\nsecondary prophylactic agent for preventing transient ischemic attacks and \\nstrokes. \\n3) Prosthetic Heart Valves and Arteriovenous Shunts:\\n Dipyridamole and \\noral anticoagulants prevent microthrombi formation on artificial heart valves. \\nThey also reduce embolism. Aspirin is not a drug  of choice in combination \\nwith warfarin due to the adverse drug reactions that may occur. \\n4) Venous Thromboembolism:  Anticoagulants are used to prevent venous \\nthromboembolism, while anti-platelet drugs are unimportant. \\n \\n2.2.6.8. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe adverse effects of \\nanti-platelet drugs include s\\ntomach upset,  heartburn, \\nnausea, constipation, flushing, dizziness, weakness, headache, bloody stools, GI \\nbleeding, rashes, liver impairment, and anaphylactic shock. \\n \\n2.2.7. Plasma Volume Expanders \\nPlasma volume expanders are the colloidal solutions  used to control the blood \\nvolume temporarily in critical conditions. Colloidal solutions with smaller size \\nparticle and lower molecular weight apply a greater oncotic pressure  (or colloid \\nosmotic pressure). Conditions of an ideal plasma volume expander are given \\nas follows: \\n1) The oncotic pressure, pH , and viscosity of the solution should be similar to \\nplasma. \\n2) It should be retained in the circulation for a sufficient duration. \\n3) It should be non-pyrogenic and non-antigenic. \\n4) It should be stable and inexpensive. \\n5) It should not inhibit blood grouping and cross matching of blood. \\n \\n2.2.7.1. \\nClassification  \\nFollowing are the important plasma volume expanders: \\n1) Human albumin,  \\n2) Dextran,  \\n3) Polyvinylpyrrolidone, \\n4) Hetastarch, \\n5) Degraded gelatin polymer. \\n \\n2.2.7.2. \\nHuman Albumin \\nAlbumin and plasma protein fraction are obtained from pooled human plasma. \\nThey are the commonly used plasma expanders and are rich protein molecules not \\nhaving any risk of hepatitis.  Around 25gm of 5% albumin is osmotically equal to \\nabout 500ml of fresh frozen plasma. Plasma protein fraction also has globulin with \\nalbumin. Plasma substitutes like dextran, hetastarch, gelatin, etc., can be used in \\ncase human albumin is not available. Albumin temporarily  increases the blood \\nvolume, which further decreases haemoglobin concentration and blood viscosity. \\nHuman albumin is used for the treatment of severe blood loss, hypervolemia, and \\nhypoproteinemia. Some common side effects include allergic or pyrogenic \\nreactions, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and hypotension. \\n', 'link': []}, 91: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on CVS and Haemopoietic System (Chapter 2)  \\n91 \\n*  \\n* \\n2.2.7.3. \\nDextran-40 \\nDextran-40 is a glucose polymer having molecular weight of 40,000. In the form \\nof 10% solution, it exerts high osmotic pressure than plasma proteins. Hence, it \\nforms a greater expansion of plasma volume than dextran of higher molecular \\nweight, while the expansion can have smaller period of action due to more fast \\nrenal excretion.  Dextran-40 is primarily used for \\nthe t reatment of shock, \\ncerebrovascular accidents, foetal distress syndrome, prevention of peritoneal \\nadhesions, and burns.  Sometimes, dextran infusions may cause hypersensitivity \\nreactions like fever, nasal congestion, joint pains, urticaria, hypotension, and \\nbronchospasm. Severe anaphylactic reactions are very uncommon and can be \\nfatal. Nausea and vomiting can also occur. After \\ndiscontinuing dextran, these \\nsymptoms can be treated symptomatically. \\n \\n2.2.7.4. \\nDextran-70 \\nDextran-70 is a glucose polymer having molecular weight of 70,000. It is formed \\nby sucrose fermentation, just like d\\nextran-40. Dextran-70 as a 6% solution \\napplies a colloidal osmotic pressure same as plasma protein. Therefore, it is used \\nfor short -term expansion of the plasma volume in situations like shock\\n or \\nimpending shock occurs due to burns, surgery, haemorrhage or trauma. It also \\ninhibits the post-operative thromboembolic disorders.  \\n \\nThe adverse effects of dextran-70 are similar as dextran-40. Dextran-70 infusions \\nare contraindicated in patients with \\nsevere CHF, bleeding disorders (like \\nhypofibrinogenemia or thrombocytopenia), and renal failure. Heparin \\nanticoagulant effect can be improved by dextran.\\n Its higher molecular weight \\ninhibits the blood group and cross matching of blood. The presence of dext\\nran \\ncan affect the determination of glucose, bilirubin, or proteins in blood or urine. \\n \\n2.2.7.5. \\nPolyvinylpyrrolidone \\nPolyvinylpyrrolidone is a synthetic polymer that affects the blood grouping and \\ncross matching of blood. It binds with insulin and penicillin in ci\\nrculation and \\ndecreases their effect. \\n \\n2.2.7.6. \\nHetastarch (Hydroxyethyl Starch) \\nHetastarch contains more than 90% of amylopectin and has an average molecular \\nweight of 4,50,000. It has a different plasma retention and volume effect. Its 6% \\niso-oncotic infusion sol ution permits blood volume regulation and an effective \\nstabilisation of blood volume. It applies same colloidal osmotic pressure \\nas \\nhuman albumin and this effect lasts for 24-36 hours. Hetastarch is used for short -\\nterm expansion of the plasma volume i\\nn sho ck or impending shock that may \\nresult from  burns, surgery, haemorrhage, or trauma.\\n Anaphylactic reactions, \\nshock, and bronchospasm  are the major adverse effects of h\\netastarch. It  does \\nnot affect the blood groupi ng and cross matching of blood.  \\n \\n2.2.7.7. \\nDegraded Gelatin Polymer \\nDegraded gelatin polymer is a polypeptide and exerts osmotic pressure similar to \\nalbumin. Polygeline is non\\n-antigenic, therefore it does not affect the blood \\ngrouping and cross matching. The plasma volume expansion of degraded gelatin \\n', 'link': []}, 92: {'text': '92 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\npolymer lasts for 12 hours. It is used in hypovolemic shock, trauma, and burns. It \\nis also used as a vehicle for drugs and for priming the heart\\n-lung machine. The \\nadverse effects \\nof degraded gelatin polymer \\ninclude urticaria, wheals, \\nhypotension tachycardia, nause a, vomiting, dyspnoea, fever, and anaphylaxis. \\nSynergistic effects of the calcium in polygeline should be considered during the \\ndigoxin therapy of patients.   \\n \\n2.3.

DIURETICS  \\n \\n3.1.1. \\nIntroduction \\nDiuretic drugs promote urine output. They act directly on the kidneys and increase \\nthe excretion of water and ions (Na+, Cl−, or\\n\\uf02d\\n3\\nHCO ) from the body. Diuretics are \\nalso used for the treatment of cardiac oedema  (accumulation of fluid in extra \\nvascular tissues), especially the one associated with congestive heart failure. They \\nare also employed in the treatment of various disorders like nephrotic syndrome, \\ndiabetes insipidus, hypertension, nutritional oedema, oed ema of pregnancy, and \\nliver cirrhosis. They also decrease the intracellular and cerebrospinal fluid pressure.\\n \\n \\n3.1.2. \\nClassification \\nOn the basis of their intensity, diuretics are categorised as follows: \\n1) High Efficacy Diuretics (Inhibitors of Na+/K+/2Cl– Co-transport)  \\ni) Sulphamoyl Derivatives: Furosemide and Bumetanide. \\nii) Phenoxyacetic Acid Derivatives: Ethacrynic acid. \\niii) Organomercurials: Mersalyl.  \\n2) Medium Efficacy Diuretics (Inhibitors of Na+/Cl– Symporter) \\ni) Benzothiadiazines (Thiazides):  Chlorothiazide, Hydrochloroth iazide, \\nBenzthiazide, Hydroflumethiazide, and Clopamide. \\nii) Thiazide-like Diuretics (Related Heterocyclics):\\n Chlorthalidone, \\nMetolazone, Xipamide, and Indapamide. \\n3) Weak or Adjunctive Diuretics \\ni) Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: Acetazolamide. \\nii) Potassium Sparing Diuretics \\na) Aldosterone Antagonists: Spironolactone. \\nb) Directly Acting Diuretics (Inhibitors of Renal Epithelial Na\\n+ \\nChannel): Triamterene and Amiloride. \\niii) Osmotic Diuretics: Mannitol, Isosorbide, and Glycerol. \\niv) Xanthine Derivatives: Theophylline.  \\n \\n3.1.3. \\nHigh Efficacy Diuretics (High Ceiling or Loop Diuretics) \\nHigh efficacy diuretics  exhibit their effects by acting on the ascending limb of \\nthe loop of Henle, therefore also known as \\nloop diuretics. They are the most  \\neffective amo ng all diuretic agents\\n, since the reabsorptive capacity of\\n the \\nascending limb of the loop of Henle \\nis very high . The loop diuretics are also \\nknown as high ceiling diuretics or Na +/K+/2Cl– co-transporter inhibitors. The \\nmost commonly used loop diuretic is furosemide. \\nCHAPTER \\n3 \\n \\n \\nPharmacology of Drugs \\nActing on Urinary System \\n', 'link': []}, 95: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Urinary System (Chapter 3)  \\n95 \\n*  \\n* \\n3.1.3.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nFurosemide inhibits the reabsorption of NaCl and the Na+/K+/2Cl– symporter in \\nthe thick ascending limb of Henle’s loop. \\nIt facilitates or \\nincreases urinary \\nexcretion of Na + and Cl – ions (figure 3.1). High efficacy diuretics  prove to be \\nhighly efficient and show dose-dependent response (increase in dose results in \\ngreater action). However, administration of exceedingly large amounts of the \\ndose may cause dehydration (high ceiling effect, i.e., maximal effect). \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3.1.3.1. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nOn oral administration, furosemide \\nabsorbs rapidly from the GIT. After \\nintravenous administration, its action furosemide is even more rapid, i.e., within \\n10 minutes and duration of action is 2 hours. About 95% of furosemide is bound \\nto t he plasma proteins. Furosemide undergoes metabolism in the liver and \\nexcretion by the kidneys. It has the ability to cross the placental barrier and \\nis \\nalso excreted in the breast milk.  The pharmacokinetic profile of some important \\nloop diuretics is enlisted in table 3.1: \\n \\nTable 3.1: Important Pharmacokinetic Characteristics of Some Loop Diuretics \\nDrugs \\nRelative  \\nPotency  \\nOral \\nBioavailability  \\nHalf-Life \\n(Hours) \\nRoutes of \\nElimination \\nFurosemide \\n1 \\n60% \\n1.5 \\n65% (renal) \\n35% (metabolised) \\nBumetanide \\n40 \\n80% \\n0.8 \\n60% (renal) \\n40% (metabolised) \\nTorsemide \\n3 \\n80% \\n3.5 \\n20% (real) \\n80% ( metabolised) \\nEthacrynic acid \\n0.8 \\n100% \\n1 \\n65% (renal) \\n35% (metabolised) \\n \\n3.1.3.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nTherapeutic uses of loop diuretics include: \\n1) Acute Pulmonary Oedema: These agents are found to be highly effective in \\nacute pulmonary oedema. In this condition, the vascular effect precedes the \\nonset of diuretic effect. A decrease in the left ventricular pressure is \\nresponsible for its therapeutic effect. \\nFigure 3.1: Na+/K+/2Cl– Co-transport System in Thick Ascending Limb \\nand the Mechanism of Action of Loop Diuretics \\n \\nATPase \\n \\nK+ \\nNa+ \\nNa+ \\n2Cl– \\nK+ \\nNa+ \\n2Cl– \\nK+ \\nCo-transporter  \\nHigh efficacy \\ndiuretics or loop \\ndiuretics \\nThick ascending limb \\nInterstitium \\nLumen  \\n', 'link': []}, 96: {'text': '96 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Refractory Oedema: Furosemide is used to treat  refractory oedema related \\nto congestive cardiac failure and renal disease, in case other diuretics are not \\neffective.   \\n3) Acute Renal Failure:  The rate of urine flow and excretion of K\\n+ ions \\nincreases during acute renal failure. Loop diuretics can effective\\nly convert \\noliguric renal failure into non-oliguric renal failure. Yet, the duration of renal \\nfailure cannot be decreased by these agents. \\n4) Hypercalcaemia: \\nIn patients with \\nhypercalcaemia, \\nintravenous \\nadministration of loop diuretics along with normal saline infusion stimulates \\nthe excretion of Ca2+ ions. As a result, the serum calcium level decreases.  \\n5) Hyperkalaemia: Intravenous administration of furosemide along with saline \\ninfusion helps treating hyperkalaemia. \\n6) Poisoning by Barbiturates and Halides: Furosemide with copious intravenous \\nsaline (forced diuresis) is used in barbiturate and halide poisoning. \\n7) Raised Intracranial Pressure:  Loop diuretics decrease the blood volume, \\nand hence reduce intracranial tension. \\n \\nThough utilised for the treatment  of several diseases, the high efficacy  diuretics \\nare not employed as antihypertensive agents since they have a high diuretic \\npotential, short duration of action, and high dose requirement. \\n \\n3.1.3.3. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe adverse reactions of high efficacy diuretics include: \\n1) Effects Related to Renal Actions: Loop diuretics severely disrupt water and \\nelectrolyte balance and may manifest as: \\ni) Hypokalaemia and metabolic hypochloremic alkalosis resulting from the \\nexchange of K+ and H+ ions with Na+ ions in the distal tubule. \\nii) Depletion of calcium on chronic administration. \\niii) Hypovolemia and hypotension. \\niv) Hyperuricemia ( may precipitate attack of gout), \\nexcept with \\nthe \\nuricosuric drugs (indacrinone and ticrynafen).  \\nv) Hypomagnesaemia which is reversed by oral magnesium \\nsupplementation. There may be wasting on chronic administration. \\n2) Effects Related to Extra-Renal Actions: These effects include: \\ni) Dose-related, reversible ototoxicity with loss of hearing. It is more with \\nethacrynic acid. \\nii) Pancreatitis. \\niii) Hypersensitivity (e.g., skin rash, blood dyscrasias, and allergic interstitial \\nnephritis) in patients allergic to sulphonamides. \\niv) Myalgia may occur with bumetanide and piretanide. \\nv) GIT upset may occur due to ethacrynic acid. \\nvi) Hepatic encephalopathy in hepatic cirrhosis. \\n \\n3.1.3.4. \\nDrug Interactions \\nLoop diuretics interact with the following drugs and cause toxicity: \\n1) They interact with aminoglycoside, antibiotics, and increase ototoxicity. \\n', 'link': []}, 97: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Urinary System (Chapter 3)  \\n97 \\n*  \\n* \\n2) They interact with cephalosporins and cause kidney damage.  \\n3) Indomethacin decreases the efficiency of loop diuretics because t hey inhibit \\nthe synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins in the kidney. \\n4) They increase the toxicity \\ncaused by digitalis and result in cardiac \\nabnormalities due to hypokalaemia. \\n \\n3.1.3.5. \\nContraindications \\nContraindications to the use of furosemide include: \\n1) Presence of anuria. \\n2) Hypersensitivity to compounds. \\n3) Allergy to sulpha drugs. \\n \\n3.1.4. Medium Efficacy Diuretics (Thiazides and Thiazide-\\nLike Drugs) \\nThiazide diuretics are referred to as \\nmoderately efficacious diuretics  as a \\nmajority (nearly 90%) of the filtered sodium is already re-absorbed even before it \\nreaches the distal tubule. They comprise of two distinct groups of diuretics: \\n1) Thiazide: These d iuretics, e.g., chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, \\npolythiazide, etc., contain a benzothiadiazine ring.  \\n2) Thiazide-Like: \\nThese diuretics, \\ne.g., \\nchlorthalidone, indapamide, \\nmetolazone, etc., do not contain benzothiadiazine ring, but an un -substituted \\nsulphonamide group. \\n \\nThe most commonly used thiazide is chlorothiazide. \\n \\n3.1.4.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThiazide diuretics act by blocking the Na+/Cl– co-transport system and exert their \\nactions on the distal convoluted tubules (figure 3.2). Carbonic anhydrase activity \\nis also inhibited by these drugs and they increase the excretion of bicarbonate \\nions, Mg+ and K +. These agents also inhibit the excretion of Ca\\n++ ions and uric \\nacid in the urine which leads to hypercalcaemia and hyperuricaemia\\n, \\nrespectively. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nATPase \\n \\nK+ \\nNa+ \\nNa+ \\nNa+ \\nCl– \\nSymport  \\nThiazides  \\nEarly distal tubule \\nInterstitium \\nLumen  \\nFigure 3.2: NaCl Reabsorption in DCT and Mechanism of Action \\nof Thiazides \\nCl– \\nK+ \\n \\nCl– \\n', 'link': []}, 98: {'text': '98 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n3.1.4.2. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nAbsorption of thiazides is fast, when they are administered orally. \\nThe organic \\nacid secretory system excretes these agents in the proximal tubule of kidneys. \\nThey inhibit the excretion of uric acid resulting in \\nhyperuricaemia. Onset of \\naction generally occurs in 1-2 hours, with the maximal effect occurring in 4\\n-6 \\nhours. The action lasts for 8-12 hours. \\n \\nActions of bendroflumethiazide last for 24 hours.  The duration of action of \\nchlorthalidone is 48-72 hours as it undergoes slow absorption. \\nThe medium \\nefficacy diuretics differ from each other only in the onset and duration of action. \\nThe mechanism of action of all the drugs in this group is similar , thus resistance \\nto any one compound in this group makes the other drugs of this group \\nalso \\nresistant for that pati ent. Moreover, beyond an acceptable  limit, the actions of \\nthis group of drugs do not depend on the dosage administered. \\n \\n3.1.4.3. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nMedium efficacy diuretics have the following therapeutic uses: \\n1) Oedema: Cardiac, hepatic and renal oedema associated with chronic heart \\nfailure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, chronic\\n renal failure , and \\nglomerulonephritis can be successfully treated using thiazides. However, \\nwhen the GFR falls below 30ml/min, thiazides are not effective. These \\nagents cannot be employed in the treatment of acute pulmonary oedema. \\n2) Hypertension: It can be effectively treated using thiazides. In the elderly and \\nobese patients, thiazides alone (as monotherapy) are useful in the treatment \\nof mild hypertension. For the treatment of moderate and severe hypertension, \\nthey are  employed as a combinational therapy \\nalong with other anti\\n-\\nhypertensives.  \\n \\nAdvantages of thiazides as anti-hypertensives include: \\ni) Low-cost, good efficiency and tolerability, decreased cardiovascular \\nmorbidity and mortality, \\nii) Effective even when administered once a day, \\niii) Shows better patient compliance, and \\niv) Additive or synergistic effect with other anti-hypertensive agents. \\n3) Calcium Nephrolithiasis: Calcium re-absorption is increased by the use of \\nthiazides by the following two mechanisms: \\ni) Increased re-absorption in the proximal tubule due to volume depletion. \\nii) Direct increase in Ca2+ ion re-absorption in the distal convoluted tubule. \\nThus, the excretion of Ca\\n2+ ions i n urine is increased by the action of \\nthiazides, and hence these agents effectively treat calcium nephrolithiasis. \\n4) Diabetes Insipidu s: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is primarily treated \\nusing thiazides. Upto 50% of urine volume is decreased by the action of \\nthiazides. They act possibly by the following mechanisms: \\ni) They promote complete re-absorption of water in the proximal tubule by \\nvolume depletion. \\nii) They increase the sensitivity of the collecting tubules to ADH. \\n', 'link': []}, 99: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Urinary System (Chapter 3)  \\n99 \\n*  \\n* \\n5) Bromide Intoxication: Bromine (a halogen) is excreted by renal processes \\nin a manner similar to those for excretion of Cl\\n– ions. Thus, bromine \\nintoxication may be treated using thiazides. \\n \\n3.1.4.4. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThough the safety margin of thiazides is wide and the toxic effects are very rare, \\nyet, in some conditions the following adverse effects may be seen: \\n1) Electrolyte disturbances may be seen in the form of hyponatremic, \\nhypochloremic metabolic alkalosis together with hypokalaemia and may \\nmanifest as weakness, fatigability, and paraesthesia. \\n2) In patients susceptible to diabetes mellitus, the suppression of insulin release \\nfrom the pancreas may exacerbate glycosuria and hyperglycaemia. \\n3) Inhibition of uric acid secretion in proximal renal tubules causes decreased \\nurinary excretion of uric acid, which may cause hyperuricemia. This \\ncondition may act as a precipitating factor for an acute attack of gout in \\npatients susceptible to it. \\n4) Administration of high doses of thiazides may result in \\nreversible \\nhyperlipidaemia (increase in serum cholesterol and LDL). \\n5) In some patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur. \\n6) Thiazides decrease the renal excretion of ammonia , and thus  can precipitate \\nhepatic encephalopathy in patients with hepatic insufficiency. \\n \\n3.1.4.5. \\nDrug Interactions \\nDrug interactions of thiazide diuretics include: \\n1) They increase the potency of  other anti -hypertensive agents, and this \\nproperty of thiazides is used therapeutically. \\n2) They induce hypokalaemia, which in turn brings about the following effects:  \\ni) Increases digitalis toxicity,  \\nii) Increases the chances of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia resulting \\nfrom quinidine and other anti-arrhythmic agents used, and \\niii) Increases the potency of neurom\\nuscular blockers and decreases the \\naction of sulphonylureas. \\n3) The use of cotrimoxazole along with diuretics increases the prevalence of \\nthrombocytopenia.  \\n4) NSAIDs reduce anti-hypertensive activity of thiazides and furosemide. \\n5) The tubular secretion of thiazid es is compet itively inhibited by probenecid, \\nwhich decreases the action of thiazide by reducing the concentration in the \\ntubular fluid. On the other hand, the uricosuric action of probenecid is \\ndiminished by probenecid. \\n6) Patients undergoing diuretic therapy  show an increase in the serum level of \\nlithium due to increased reabsorption of Li\\n+ ions (and Na + ions) in the \\nproximal tubule.  \\n \\n3.1.4.6. \\nContraindications \\nIn patients sensitive to sulpha drugs, thiazide diuretics should be used cautiously. \\nIf possible, these drugs should be avoided in such patients. \\n', 'link': []}, 100: {'text': '100 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n3.1.5. \\nWeak  or Adjunctive Diuretics \\nThe third category of diuretics based on their intensity is the weak diuretics. They \\nare named so because they exert a very weak action of their own, and hence are \\nusually employed as an adjunctive agent to potentiate the effects of other agents. \\nThus, they are also termed as adjunctive diuretics. \\n \\n3.1.5.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe mechanism of action of each class of weak diuretics is given below: \\n1) Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: \\nAcetazolamide inhibit s \\ncarbonic \\nanhydrase enzyme, thus prevent the  formation of H + ions. As a result, the \\nexchange of Na+/H+ ions does not take place. The Na+ ions are excreted in the \\nurine along with\\n\\uf02d\\n3\\nHCO  ions ( figure 3.3). In the distal convoluted tubule,  \\nincreased Na+/K+ exchange leads to loss of K+ ions. Thus, the overall effect is \\nthe loss of Na+, K+ and \\n\\uf02d\\n3\\nHCO  ions in the urine or alkaline urine. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2) Potassium Sparing Diuretics: The late distal tubule and the collecting duct \\nhave two types of cells, i.e., the principal cell and intercalated cells. The \\nNa+ ion channel present in the luminal membrane of the principal cells \\nprovides pathway for the entry of Na\\n+ ions into the ce lls, down the \\nelectrochemical gradient. This electrochemical gradient is created by the \\nbasolateral Na + pump. The luminal membrane is highly permeable to Na\\n+ \\nions, thereby creating a lumen negative trans -epithelial potential difference. \\nThis potential diff erence provides an important driving force enabling the \\nsecretion of K+ ions into the lumen (figure 3.4). \\n \\nThe H + is secreted into the tubular lumen by the intercalated cells. This \\nsecretion occurs by the H+-ATPase pump or proton pump (figure 3.4) and the \\nlumen negative trans-epithelial voltage difference that acts as the driving force. \\nThe potassium sparing diuretics (amiloride and triamterene) block the Na+ ion \\nchannels in the luminal membrane of the principal cells in the late distal tubule \\nand collecting duct. This inhibits the transport of Na+ ions through the cells, \\nFigure 3.3: Mechanism of Action of Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) Inhibitors  \\n \\n \\nATPase \\nK+ \\nNa+ \\nNa+ \\nPCT \\nInterstitium \\nLumen  \\n\\uf02d\\nHCO\\uf033\\n \\nH+ \\nH+ \\n\\uf02d\\nHCO\\uf033\\n \\nH2CO3 \\n\\uf02d\\nHCO3\\n \\n+ \\nH2CO3 \\nCO2 + H2O \\nCO2 + H2O \\nCarbonic \\nanhydrase  \\nCarbonic \\nanhydrase  \\nCA inhibitors \\nAntiport  \\nCA inhibitors \\n', 'link': []}, 101: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Urinary System (Chapter 3)  \\n101 \\n*  \\n* \\nthereby reducing the luminal secretion of H + ions from the intercalated cells \\nand K+ ions from the principal cells.

It \\nproduces adverse effects like acidosis and hypokalaemia. Thus, it is  not used \\nas a diuretic anymore. Currently it is being employed for the treatment of:  \\ni) Glaucoma: As an adjuvant to other ocular hypotensives. \\nii) Alkalinising Urine: For urinary tract infection or to promote excretion \\nof certain acidic drugs. \\niii) Epilepsy: As an adjuvant in absence of seizures when primary drugs are \\nnot fully effective. \\niv) Acute Mountain Sickness: Symptomatic relief as well as prophylaxis. \\n2) Potassium Sparing Diuretics: Triamterene and amiloride are used together \\nwith thiazide and loop diuretics. They do not allow  hyperkalaemia to occur \\nand increase the natriuretic and antihypertensive response slightly. \\n3) Osmotic Diuretics: These diuretics are used in:  \\ni) Reduction of intracranial pressure in cerebral oedema and in\\ntraocular \\npressure in glaucoma,  \\nii) Prevention of oliguria or anuria, and \\niii) Differentiation of pre -renal failure from renal failure (acute tubular \\nnecrosis), once oliguria has set in.

ANTI-DIURETICS \\n \\n3.2.1. \\nIntroduction \\nAnti-diuretic drugs decrease the volume of urine by suppressing urine formation. \\nThese drugs are primarily indicated for patients with diabetes insipidus.                               \\n \\n3.2.2. \\nClassification \\nAnti-diuretics are classified as follows: \\n1) Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH, Vasopressin), Desmopressin, Lypressin, and \\nTerlipressin. \\n2) Thiazide Diuretics: Amiloride. \\n3) Miscellaneous: Indomethacin, Chlorpropamide, and Carbamazepine. \\n \\n3.2.3. \\nAntidiuretic Hormone \\nAntidiuretic H ormone (ADH) is a non -peptide hormone. It is secreted by the \\nneurohypophysis part of posterior pituitary. \\nADH synthesis occurs in the \\n', 'link': []}, 106: {'text': '106 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nhypothalamic (supraoptic and paraventricular) nerve cell bodies. It is synthesised \\nin the form of a large p\\nrecursor peptid e together with its binding protein \\n(neurophysin). It is transported along the axons to the nerve endings in the \\nmedian eminence and pars nervosa. Its secretion occurs via posterior pituitary \\n(neurohypophysis), together with oxytocin.  \\n \\nThe rate of ADH release is regulated by the receptors present in left atrium, \\nventricles and pulmonary veins\\n, and by osmoreceptors present in the \\nhypothalamus. Hydration of body governs ADH release, which is also affected \\nby impulses from baroreceptors and higher centres in \\nthe brain. An increase in \\nthe osmolarity of plasma and contraction \\nof ECF volume form the two main \\nphysiological stimuli for ADH release. Angiotensin II, Prostaglandins (\\nPGs), \\nhistamine, neuropeptide Y, and ACh increase ADH secretion. On the other hand, \\nADH secretion is inhibited by \\nGABA and Atrial Natriuretic Peptides (ANP). \\nAgent-specific action is seen by opioids; endogenous opioid peptides usually \\ninhibit ADH secretion, while morphine stimulates its secretion.  \\n \\nADH present in mammals is \\ntermed 8-Arginine-Vasopressin (AVP). The \\npeptide analogues of ADH, having an agonistic as well as an antagonistic action , \\nhave also been artificially synthesised, which have been found to possess a \\nhigher potency and are longer acting.  \\n \\n3.2.3.1. \\nADH (Vasopressin) Receptor \\nVasopressin receptors are G\\n-protein coupled cell -membrane receptors. T he \\nfollowing two sub-types of vasopressin receptors have been identified: \\n1) V1 Receptors: All vasopressin receptors are of V1 type, excluding the ones \\non the cells of the Collecting Duct in the \\nkidneys and a few blood vessels. \\nFurther, the V1 receptors are divided into:  \\ni) V1a Receptors: Located on the vascular and other smooth muscles, \\nplatelets, liver, etc.  \\nii) V1b Receptors: Located on the anterior pituitary. \\n \\nThe V 1 receptors act via phospholipase  C-IP3/DAG pathway. They release \\nCa2+ ions and result in vasoconstriction, visceral smooth muscle contraction, \\nglycogenolysis, platelet aggregation, ACTH release, etc.  \\n2) V2 Receptors: These receptors are present on the cells of the Collecting Duct \\n(CD) in t he kidney s. Blood vessels form the site of occurrence for the \\nvasodilatory V 2 receptors. The water permeability of these receptors is \\nregulated via cAMP production. ADH is more sensitive to V\\n2 receptors as \\ncompared to the V1 receptors. \\n \\n3.2.3.2. \\nVasopressin Analogues \\nThe vasopressin analogues used as antidiuretics are:  \\n1) Lypressin: It is an analogue o f 8-lysine vasopressin. It is less potent than \\nAVP. It exerts its action on both\\n V1 and V 2 receptors. It acts for a long \\nduration (4-6 hours). It is employed for the actions mediated by V1 receptors.  \\n', 'link': []}, 107: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Urinary System (Chapter 3)  \\n107 \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Terlipressin: It is a synthetic preparation of vasopressin. It is a prodrug for \\nvasopressin analogues. It is employed in the treatment of bleeding \\noesophageal varices. Its adverse effects are less severe as compared to thos e \\nproduced by lypressin. \\n3) Desmopressin (dDAVP): It is a synthetic peptide of vasopressin. It exerts a \\nselective V2 agonistic activity. Its potency as an antidiuretic is 12 times more \\nthan that of AVP. \\nIts vasoconstrictor action is negligible. \\nIts e nzymatic \\ndegradation is relatively slower, and therefore the duration of action is more.  \\n \\nHalf-life of desmopressin is 1-2 hours and duration of action is 8-12 hours. It \\nis employed for the actions mediated by V 2 receptors. The preferred route of \\nits administration is intranasal, although its bioavailability by this route is \\nonly 10-20%.  \\n \\nAn oral formulation of desmopressin has been marketed in the recent past. \\nThough the dosage of this oral formulation is 10 -15 times more than that of \\nthe intranasal formulation, yet it is advantageous since the nasal and systemic \\nside effects can be avoided by this route. Bioavailabili\\nty of this oral \\nformulation is 1-2%. In a majority of patients, oral tablets are consumed \\nmore conveniently than the intranasal spray. \\n \\n3.2.3.3. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe V2 sub-receptors are present on the basolateral side of the cell membrane of \\ncollecting duct. These receptors on activation\\n increase the cAMP formation \\nintracellularly; this further result  in the activation of cAMP -dependent protein \\nkinase A.  \\n \\nIntracellular cAMP formation increases with an increase in the activation of \\nV2 \\nreceptors. Hence, the activation of cAMP -dependent protein kinase A increases \\nand the relevant proteins are phosphor\\nylated, which in turn stimulate\\n the \\nexocytosis of aquaporin-2 [a Water Channel Containing Vesicle (WCV )] via \\napical membrane. Thus, within the apical membrane, the insertion \\nof aqueous \\nchannels increases.  \\n \\nEndocytosis and degradation rates of WCVs decrease simultaneously. In the \\napical membrane, water permeability through the cells of\\n collecting duct  \\nincreases in relation to the population of aquaporin-2 channels, at any given time. \\nIn addition to this, stimulation of V 2 receptors continually (during chronic water \\ndeprivation) results in an up -regulation of the sy nthesis of aquaporin -2 through \\nthe cAMP response element of the gene that encodes aquaporin-2. \\n \\nAquaporin-1 (in proximal tubule) and aquaporin\\n-3 and \\n-4 (on basolateral \\nmembrane of the cells of collecting duct ) also help in the transport of water at \\ntheir respective sites. Response of the kidneys to ADH is also shown by the \\nV1 \\nreceptors, which include: \\n1) The V1a receptors on activation cause constriction of vasa recta. As a result, \\nthe inner medulla receives a decreased blood flow and this helps to maintain \\na high osmolarity in this area, thereby contributing to anti-diuresis.  \\n', 'link': []}, 108: {'text': '108 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Other actions of V1 receptors that increase prostaglandin production from the \\ninterstitial cells and directly decrease the response of collecting duct cells to \\nV2 receptor stimulation restrict the water permeability mediated by V\\n2 \\nreceptors.  \\n3) Under physiological conditions, actions of V 1 receptors may aid in limiting \\nthe effect of V2 receptors when the blood concentration of AVP is very high. \\nThis is because the actions of V2 are produced at much lower levels of AVP. \\n \\n3.2.3.4. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nTrypsin destructs AVP, therefore is orally inactive. It should be administered either \\nby a parenteral route or by intranasal route. Rapid enzymatic cleavage of the \\npeptide chain of AVP occurs in many organs, particularly in the liver and kidneys. \\nThe plasma half -life of AVP administered as a drug is s\\nhort (approximately 25 \\nminutes). The activity of aqueous vasopressin lasts only for 3-4 hours. \\n \\n3.2.3.5. \\nPharmacological Actions \\nThe pharmacological actions of antidiuretic drugs are given below: \\n1) Kidney: Permeability to water in the cells  of collecting duct  is increased by \\nthe action of AVP. This means that equilibrium is achieved with the renal \\nmedulla (in which the osmolarity is more) , and thus water diffuses from the \\nlumen into the interstitium. In the absence of ADH, the cells of collecting duct \\nare not permeable to water. As a result, dilute urine is formed \\n(since it is \\npassed as produced by the diluting segment). When the concentration of ADH \\ndecreases, a graded effect is seen and the volume of urine strictly balances the \\nintake of fluids. \\n2) Blood Vessels: AVP acts on V 1 receptors to constrict the blood vessels, thus \\nincreasing BP. Therefore it is also termed as vasopressin. However, this effect \\nis achieved only at a mu ch larger concentration of AVP than that required to \\nproduce the anti -diuretic effect. Action of AVP is thus not physiologically \\nsignificant. Constriction is seen in the cutaneous, mesenteric, skeletal muscle, \\nfat depot, thyroid, and coronary beds. \\n3) Other A ctions: The anti -diuretics cause contraction of most of the other \\nvisceral smooth muscles. They may also increase peristalsis in gut (especially \\nlarge bowel), evacuation and expulsion of gases:  \\ni) Uterus: AVP acts on oxytocin receptors resulting in \\nuterus co ntraction. \\nThe potency of AVP is same as that of oxytocin in a non\\n-pregnant uterus \\nand in an early pregnancy uterus. \\nii) CNS: When administered exogenously, AVP does not cross the blood\\n-\\nbrain barrier. At present, AVP has been known as a peptide \\nneurotransmitter in several areas of the brain and spinal cord, which may \\nbe involved in the regulation of temperature, circulation, \\nACTH release, \\nand in learning various tasks. \\n \\nPlatelet aggregatio n and hepatic glycogenolysis have\\n been induced by \\nAVP. Coagulation factor VIII and von Willebrand’s factor has been found \\nto be released by AVP from the vascular endothelium via V2 receptors. \\n', 'link': []}, 109: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Urinary System (Chapter 3)  \\n109 \\n*  \\n* \\n3.2.3.6. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe therapeutic uses of vasopressin analogues are as follows: \\n1) Based on V1 Actions \\ni) Bleeding Esophageal Varices:\\n Vasopressin/terlipressin constricts \\nmesenteric blood vessels and decreases the blood flow from liver to the \\nvarices, thereby allowing a clot to form. Thus, these agents help stop \\nbleeding.  \\nii) Before Abdominal Radiography: \\nAVP/lypressin is sometimes \\nemployed to make the bowel free of gases. \\n2) Based on V2 Actions (Desmopressin is the Drug of Choice) \\ni) Diabetes Insipidus: The most significant use of vasopressin analogue is \\nin neurogenic diabetes insipidus. In renal diabetes insipidus, these agents \\nare not as effective as th e kidneys do not respond to ADH. Except in a \\nfew patients where DI occurs transiently ( e.g., those with head injury or \\nneurosurgery), vasopressin therapy is required throughout the life. \\nii) Bedwetting in Children and Nocturia in Adults:\\n Administration of \\ndecompression either by intranasal or oral route  at bedtime reduces the \\nvolume of urine and thus helps in controlling primary nocturia.  \\niii) Renal Concentration Test: Concentration of urine is maximum when 5-\\n10U of aqueous vasopressin (im) or 2µg of desmopressin is administered. \\niv) Haemophilia and von Willebrand’s Disease: AVP releases coagulation \\nfactor VIII and von Willebrand’s factor , therefore checks bleeding. The \\npreferred drug of choice for this disease is desmopressin, administered in \\na dose of 0.3µg/kg diluted in 50ml saline and infused IV over 30 minutes. \\n \\n3.2.3.7. \\nAdverse Effects \\nDesmopressin selectively acts onV\\n2 receptors, and thus shows lesser adverse \\neffects as compared to vasopressin, lypressin , or terlipressin. Yet, flushing and \\ntransient headache are commonly seen. Local application of these agents results \\nin the occurrence of irritation in the nose, congestion, rhinitis, ulceration and \\nepistaxis.

For such patients, high ceiling diuretics may also be \\nefficacious, however they are less wanted since their action is very short and \\nbrisk. The anti -diuretic effect of these thiazide agents is due to decreased urine \\noutput in both types of diabetes, pituitary as well as renal \\ndiabetes insipidus . \\nThey are part icularly effecting in the treatment of renal \\ndiabetes insipidus  in \\nwhich AVP is not effective.

A possible mechanism of its action can be as follows:  \\n1) Thiazides bring about a state of continued electrolyte depletion, as a result of \\nwhich a further complete iso\\n-osmotic reabsorption of glomerular filtrate \\noccurs in the proximal tubule. Additionally, lesser dilute urine \\nreaches the \\ncollecting duct in a small volume due to reduced salt reabsorption in the \\ncortical diluting segment. Thus, the lesser dilute urine in smaller volume is \\npassed out. This mechanism of action is confirmed by the fact that restriction \\nof salts has a similar effect.  \\n2) The second mechanism of action \\nis that the thiazides produce their anti -\\ndiuretic effect by reducing glomerular filtration rate, and thus the fluid load \\non tubules. \\n \\n3.2.4.2. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe most significant use of amiloride is \\nthe management of lithium -induced \\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus .

AUTOCOIDS  \\n \\n4.1.1. \\nIntroduction  \\nThe word autocoids derive  its origin from the Greek words autos meaning self \\nand akos meaning healing element . Autocoids are chemical signals produced \\nby different cells of the body. They act locally at the site where they\\n are \\nsynthesised and released (\\ne.g., at the site of inflammation within the \\ninflammatory pockets).  \\n \\nAutocoids are chemical substances that are produced within the cells and are \\nreleased in response to different stimuli to cause various p\\nhysiological actions. \\nMostly the action of auto coids is localised but large amounts of them can be \\ntransported through circulation to exert their eff\\nects at sites, other than where  \\nthey are synthesised. Since autocoids act locally, they are also described as local \\nhormones.  \\n \\nAutocoids are biologically active compounds which act on smooth muscles of \\ndifferent tissues. Pathological conditions like inflammation, allergy, and \\nhypersensitivity result from an imbalance in their synthesis or release. Autocoids \\ninclude a wide range of substances having different structure and \\npharmacological activities, \\ne.g., histamine, serotonin, eicosanoids, Platelet\\n-\\nActivating Factor (PAF), and several polypeptides. \\n \\n4.1.2. \\n Classification \\nDepending on their chemical classes  (amines, peptides, or lipids), autocoids are \\ncategorised as follows: \\n1) Amines: Histamines and Serotonin (or 5-HT). \\n2) Polypeptides: Bradykinin and Angiotensin. \\n3) Lipids: \\ni) Eicosanoids or Arachidonic Acid Metabolites:\\n \\nLeukotrienes, \\nThromboxanes, and Prostaglandins. \\nii) Platelet activating factor.  \\n \\n4.1.3. \\nHistamine \\nHistamine is a nitrogen-containing organic compound belonging to the group of \\namines. It is  produced in almost all the \\nanimal cells during a local immune \\nresponse. It regulates various physiological functions  of the gut. In addition, it \\nalso play s a role in neurotra nsmission. Release of histamine  is the initiating \\nfactor of any inflammatory response.  \\nCHAPTER \\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\nAutocoids \\n', 'link': []}, 114: {'text': '114 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nHistamine is synthesised and released on stimulation of basophils and mast cells \\n(found in the nearby connective tissues) as a part of an immune res ponse against \\nforeign pathogens . This causes  increased vascular (capillary) permeability for \\nWBCs and other proteins to facilitate adequate invasion of foreign bodies present \\nwithin the tissues.  \\n \\n4.1.3.1. \\nBiosynthesis \\nHistamine is a hydrophilic compound containing an imidazole ring and an amino \\ngroup linked by two methylene groups. \\nIt shows wide distribution in living \\norganisms and is found in venoms, bacteria, and plants, ranging in amount fro m \\n1-100\\uf06dg/g. \\n \\nHistamine is synthesised by the decarboxylation of histidine (an amino acid), \\ncatalysed by the enzyme L -Histidine Decarboxylase (HDC). Histidine consumed \\nin diet also forms a source for the synthesis of histamine by the action of the \\ndiverse microbial-flora present in the gut. The riboside of imidazole acetic acid is \\nthe end product of the cycle of histamine synthesis , which is active in negligible \\namounts and is excreted via urine (figure 4.1). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHistamine undergoes degradation more significantly by the N-Methyl transferase \\ndegradation pathway. Fluoromethyl histidine acts as a suicidal inhibitor for the \\nenzyme L-histidine decarboxylase. Mast cells are the primary storage sites for \\nhistamine in almost all the tissues. However, when i\\nn the blood,  it is the \\ncirculating basophil. Mast cells exhibit histidine decarboxylase activity and show \\nthe presence of some specific granules for the storage of histamine, heparin, \\nneutrophil chemotactic factor, eosinophil chemotactic factor, and few enzymes. \\n \\nSeveral biological fluids, platelets, and leuk ocytes have been found to con tain \\nhistamine in small amounts;\\n also cerebrospinal fluid contains \\na significant \\namount of histamine. \\n \\nSites other than the mast cells for the synthesis and storage of hista\\nmine \\ncomprises of epidermal cells, gastrointestinal mucosal cells, cells within the \\nregenerating tissues, and the neurons. Gastric mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract \\nhas max imum concentration of histamine;\\n and this concentration constantly \\ndecreases in t he distal part because the regular fresh synthesised histamine \\nis \\nFigure 4.1: Synthesis and Metabolism of Histamine \\nL-histidine \\ndecarboxylase \\nHistidine \\nHistamine \\nHistamine N-methyl \\ntransferase \\nN-methyl histamine \\nN-methyl imidazole acetic acid \\nImidazole acetic acid \\nUrine \\nDiamine \\noxidase \\nMAO \\n', 'link': []}, 115: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n115 \\n*  \\n* \\nreleased out and not stored. On the other hand, when histamine concentration is \\nfound to be depleted in the tissues with rich am ounts of mast cells, it may take \\nseveral weeks for its concentration to be restored to its normal value. \\n \\n4.1.3.2. \\nHistamine Receptor Subtypes \\nH1, H 2, and H 3 types of histaminergic receptors \\nmediate all the biological \\neffects of histamine. When histamine was recognised and the anti\\n-histamines \\n(H1 blockers) were  produced at the starting of this century , it was known that \\nall the histamine actions \\ncannot be blocked. \\nThe Nobel Laureate , James \\nBlack identified the H2 receptors. Recently, evidence for the existence of H\\n3 \\nreceptors has been \\ndiscovered.

The release of histamines in epidermis results in itching\\n, \\nwhereas its release in dermis results in pain mediated via H\\n1 receptors. The \\nresponse to insect bites, in the form of urticaria (hives), mainly involves the \\nsensory nerve stimulation. \\n2) Cardiovascular System \\ni) Blood Vessels: Histamine causes constriction of large blood vessels and \\ndilatation of small arterioles. In humans, the most significant action of \\nhistamines is vasodilatation (decrease in blood pressure) involving both \\nH1 and H2 receptors. Activation of H1 receptors via Endothelium-Derived \\nRelaxing Factor (E DRF) (NO/PGI 2) is responsible for short -lived and \\nrapid vasodilatation. \\n', 'link': []}, 117: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n117 \\n*  \\n* \\n \\nVasodilatation caused  by the activation of H\\n2 receptors occurs slowly \\nand continues (associated with a decrease in BP) via the cAMP\\n-PKA \\npathway. A low dose of H\\n1-receptor antagonists blocks the histamine \\nresponse, while a high dose of the same blunts the initial phase of the \\nresponse, which is seen to be quite large. A fall in the systemic blood \\npressure is generally complemented by reflex tachycardia. \\nii) Increased Capillary Permeability:\\n This effect  is observed by \\nstimulation of H\\n1 receptors  that cause  contraction and separation of \\nendothelial cells. Thus, plasma proteins and fluids are allowed to \\nenter the extracellular space, resulting in oedema (a manifestation of \\nurticaria).  \\niii) Lewis’s T riple Response: In 1927, Lewis observed a characteristic  \\nTriple Response (TR)  on injecting histamine via intradermal route. It is \\nmarked by the following features: \\na) The injection site appears to be surrounded by a localised red \\ncoloured spot within a few se conds that maximises within a minute. \\nThe vasodilatory action of histamine causes such response. \\nb) A bright red coloured flare or flush is seen surrounding the initial red \\nspot by up to a centimetre. Stimulation of axon reflexes by histamine \\nleading to an indirect vasodilatation is responsible for the same.  \\nc) After 1 or 2 minutes, a wheal  or a swelling is seen at the injection \\nsite and also surrounding it. The fluid and protein exudation from the \\npost-capillary venules is responsible for such symptoms. \\niv) Histamine Shock:  Intravenous administration of histamine in large \\ndoses (as during anaphylaxis) causes an intense fall in blood pressure. \\nThis occurs as a result of the dilatation of blood vessels, which acquires \\nmore blood, thus increasing permeability, and decreasing venous return \\nand cardiac output.   \\nv) Heart: The contractility of heart increases \\ndue to  stimulation of H\\n2 \\nreceptors. Thus, a stimulation of cardiac automaticity as well as SA and \\nAV nodal activities is observed. \\n3) Histamine and Allergic Reaction: Once antigen interacts with IgE antibody \\n(or Fc receptor) present on the mast cell surface, the stored histamine is \\nreleased. This condition is evident in atopic individuals (immediate \\nhypersensitivity reaction is seen followed by allergy, i.e., smooth muscle \\nrelaxation and vasodilatation). \\n \\nMany drugs , e.g., d-tubocurarine, morphine, vancomycin, polymyxin\\n-B, \\ndextran, radiocontrast dyes, etc., have the property of releasing histamine \\nfrom mast cells, without sensitisation, but not from non\\n-mast cells or \\ntissues ( e.g., gastric mucosa, epidermis, rapidly growing tissues, and CNS \\nneurons). But these agents may cause anaphylactoid reaction (i.e., fall in \\nblood pressure, tachycardia, headache, urticaria\\n, bronchospasm, and red \\nskin). \\n', 'link': []}, 118: {'text': '118 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nHistamine from non\\n-mast cells plays\\n a major role in regulating the \\nsecretion of gastric acid. It is also responsible for controlling the release of \\nneurotransmitters (such as substance P and bradykinin ). Pathological states \\nlike myeloid leukaemia and carcinoid tumour (showing an increase in\\n \\nbasophil count) are associated with an increase in histamine which causes \\npruritus and flushing, respectively. Cold urticaria, solar urticaria, \\ncholinergic urticaria, scratching urticaria, etc., are also associated with \\n histamine release.  \\nRelease of his tamines is the only cause for an allergic reaction; however, it \\nhas now been proved that sensitised mast cells also release histamine along \\nwith various other substances, such as eicosanoids, PAF, kinins, and 5-HT.  \\n4) Histamine and Gastric Acid Secretion:  Histamine is a potent gastric acid \\nsecretion mediated by the action of H\\n2 receptors on gastric parietal cells. If \\nH2 receptors are blocked, the secretion of acid in response to histamine, \\ngastrin, and vagal stimulation is eliminated. Patients suffering from \\npeptic \\nulcer are treated with H2 receptor antagonists. \\n5) Action on Smooth Muscles:\\n Smooth muscles contract \\nand relax on \\nactivation of H1 and H2 receptors, respectively. The most important action of \\nH1 receptors is to mediate constriction of bronchial muscles\\n in asthma \\npatients; however, this response is not so prominent among individuals not \\nsuffering from any such disease. Relaxant responses precipitated by the \\nstimulation of H2 receptor are overshadowed by the dominant H1 action. \\n \\n4.1.3.5. \\nPathophysiological Actions \\nThe various pathophysiological actions exerted by histamine are: \\n1) Gastric Secretion: HCl secretion in stomach is mediated by histamines, and \\nit shows a high turnover rate. On being stimulated, histamine is rel\\neased \\nlocally from histaminocytes present near the parietal cells. \\n2) Allergic Phenomena: Histamine primarily mediates \\nhypersensitivity \\nreactions. Histamine is released from the mast cells, and an antigen-antibody \\nreaction occurs on \\ntheir surface resulting \\nin urticaria, angioedema, \\nbronchoconstriction, and anaphylactic shock. \\nThe hypothalamus and \\nmidbrain have non-mast cell histamine which is responsible for restlessness. \\n3) Inflammation: Histamines mediate vasodilatation and changes occurring \\nduring inflammation . Leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium is \\npromoted by histamines by the expression of adhesion molecule\\n, i.e., P-\\nselectin on endothelial cell surface. This leads  to the sequestration of \\nleukocytes at the \\ninflammation site. Histamine may also help in \\nthe \\nregulation of microcirculation depending on the local needs. \\n4) Tissue Growth and Repair: Histamine has been implicated in the process of \\ntissue growth and repair since \\ngrowing and regenerating tissues contain \\nhistamine in high concentrations. \\n5) Headache: Histamine also plays a role in headache that is vascular in origin, \\nalthough no conclusive evidence has been obtained as yet. \\n', 'link': []}, 119: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n119 \\n*  \\n* \\n4.1.3.6. \\nHistamine Agonists \\nAlong with histamine, the other drugs that act as histamine agonists are: \\n1) Betazole: Its activity is ten times greater at H2-receptors than at H1-receptors. \\n2) Impromidine: It is  used for investigations with about 10,000 H\\n2 to H 1 \\nactivity ratio. \\n3) Methimepip: It is a histamine agonist acting specifically against H\\n3 receptors. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nHistamine agonists are mainly used for diagnostic purposes. They are primarily \\nemployed for allergy testing, for the assessment of histamine sensitivity , and for \\ntesting the function of gastric secretion (they have \\nbeen replaced with \\npentagastrin, which is \\na synthetic peptide analogue of gastrin having lesser \\nadverse effects). \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nHistamine agonists may cause f\\nlushing, burning sensations, \\nhypotension, \\ntachycardia, and bronchoconstriction. \\n \\n4.1.4. \\nHistamine Antagonists (Antihistamines) \\nHistamine antagonists are the drugs that antagonise the \\nhistamine action. \\nFollowing are the three types of histamine receptor antagonists: \\n1) H1-Antagonists: These are classical antihistamines \\nwhich block  the \\nphysiological effects of histamine and are used in allergic disorders. \\n2) H2-Antagonists: Cimetidine, Ranitidine, and Famotidine are the examples \\nof H2-antagonists which reduce the  gastric HCl secretion and are used in \\npeptic ulcer.  \\n3) H3-Antagonists: Thioperamide is an example of H3-antagonist which \\nregulates histamine release from histaminergic neurons of CNS by \\npresynaptic auto-regulatory mechanism. It is not recommended to be used \\ntherapeutically. \\n \\nThe effects of histamine can be antagonised by two groups of drugs: \\n1) Physiological Antagonists: The classical example of this group of histamine \\nantagonist is adrenaline. These  antagonists act at different receptor sites on \\nthe same biological system but elicit opposite response; \\nfor example,  \\nhistamine acts on H\\n1 receptors of bronchial smoo\\nth muscles and blood \\nvessels to elicit bronchoconstriction and vasodilatation or fall in BP, whereas \\nadrenaline acts as \\uf0622-receptors of bronchial smooth muscles and α1-receptor \\nof blood vessels to produce bronchodila tion and vasoconstriction or rise of \\nBP and thereby counteracts the deleterious effects of histamine in \\nanaphylactic shock. \\n2) Pharmacological or Receptor Antagonists:  These antagonists are either \\ncompetitive or non-competitive inhibitors of histamine at receptor sites. They \\nblock the effects of histamine by receptor occupancy. \\n', 'link': []}, 120: {'text': '120 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n4.1.4.1. \\nH1-Antagonists \\nUntil the discovery of H\\n1 receptors, no other histamine receptors had been \\nidentified. H 1 antagonists were termed as \\nantihistamines. They cause a \\ncompetitive inhi bition of only H\\n1 receptors. Adrenaline (a physiological \\nantagonist of histamine\\n) acts via adrenergic receptors and reverses the \\nbronchodilation and vasoconstriction effects of histamine. Histamine release \\nfrom mast cells is blocked by cromolyn sodium and corticosteroids. H1 receptor \\nantagonists are employed in the treatment of allergic disorders. \\n \\nClassification \\n1) First Generation  H1-Antagonists: They cross \\nthe blood-brain barrier \\nreadily and produce drowsiness.  \\ni) Ethanolamines: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride and Dimenhydrinate. \\nii) Ethylenediamines: \\nPyrilamine maleate and T\\nripelennamine \\nhydrochloride. \\niii) Alkylamines: Chlorpheniramine maleate and Brompheniramine maleate. \\niv) Piperazines: Cyclizine hydrochloride and Meclizine hydrochloride. \\nv) Piperidines: Cyproheptadine hydrochloride. \\nvi) Phenothiazines: Promethazine hydrochloride. \\nvii) Tricyclic Dibenzoxepins: Doxepin hydrochloride. \\n2) Second Generation H1-Antagonists: They do not cross \\nthe blood-brain \\nbarrier readily, thus produce less drowsiness. \\ni) Alkylamines: Acrivastine. \\nii) Piperazines: Cetirizine hydrochloride. \\niii) Phthalazinones: Azelastine hydrochloride. \\niv) Piperidines: Terfenadine, Astemizole, Loratadine, and Fexofenadine. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe action of histamines on H\\n1 receptors is blocked by antihistamines (H\\n1 \\nblockers) categorised in to first - and second -generations. The binding of first-\\ngeneration antihistamines is seen on central and peripheral H\\n1 receptors while \\nthat of second-generation antihistamines is seen  on peripheral H 1 receptors. \\nThough the sedative effects of second\\n-generation antihistamines are lesser as \\ncompared to those of first -generation antihistamine, still they are beneficial for \\nthe treatment of allergies. \\n \\nPharmacological Actions \\n1) Histamine Antagonism:  The histamine actions ( e.g., dilatation of \\ncapillaries, decrease in BP, urticaria, allergic reactions, itching, contraction \\nof smooth muscles, and triple response formation) are effectively blocked by \\nH1 antihistamines. However anaphylactic shock is only partially prevented by \\nantihistamines. It should be remembered tha\\nt histamine is not alwa ys the \\nonly cause of an allergy, \\nso all allergic reactions may not be blocked by \\nantihistamines; for example,  leukotriene and PAF are more significant \\nmediators in asthma, thus they cannot be controlled by antihistamines alone. \\nH1 blockers also show no effect on HCl secretion. \\n', 'link': []}, 121: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n121 \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Anti-Allergic Reactions: The allergic reactions like urticaria, itching, and \\nangioedema can be controlled by the action of H 1 antagonists; however, it is \\nnot practically possible to control anaphylaxis and asth\\nma as they are \\nmediated by factors other than histamine. \\n3) Effects on CNS: H1-antihistamines show sedative effects on CNS; however, \\na quantitative difference is seen depending on the capability of a compound \\nto cross the blood-brain barrier. They are also seen to accelerate the effects of \\nCNS depressants. Promethazine (phenargan) possesses sedative effects. \\nRecently discovered H1 antagonists (e.g., astemizole, terfenadine, loratadine, \\ncetirizine, and fexofenadine) do not possess sedative effects because they do \\nnot show absorption in brain. \\n4) Anticholinergic Actions: Diphenhydramine, promethazine, and pheniramine \\nare the H\\n1-antihistamines acting as potent anticholinergic agents. They \\nreduce lacrimal and nasal secretions while accounting for dryness of mouth. \\nThis anticholinergic action is beneficial for treating conditions like motion \\nsickness and Parkinsonism. \\n5) Antiemetic and Antitussive Actions:  Morning sickness (vomiting during \\npregnancy) and motion sickness can be effectively prevented by some H\\n1-\\nantihistamines. \\n6) Local Anaesthetic Effect:  Some antihistamines ( e.g., mepyramine and \\nantazoline) possess local anaesthetic effects, still are not employed for this \\npurpose. \\n7) Blood Pressure: Intravenous administration of most antihistamines results in \\na decrease in blood pressure which is not seen in case of oral administration \\nof these agents. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\n1) Allergic Disorders: H1 antihistamines provide symptomatic relief to various \\nallergic states like  urticaria, acute or chronic dermatitis, pruritus, hay fever, \\nand a llergic rhinitis. Itching and urticaria occurring as a result of drug \\nreactions can be treated using H1 blockers. Though they are known to prevent \\nthe occurrence of anaphylaxis , however once anaphylactic conditions result, \\nthey are not able to treat the same. For example, adrenaline is the drug of \\nchoice in treating anaphylactic conditions , while glucocorticoids are used to \\ntreat the long-lasting effects after anaphylaxis. \\n \\nH1 receptor blockers are ineffective to treat asthma mediated by histamine \\nand other  mediators. They are useful in the treatment of allergic reactions \\nresulting from insect bite (bees and wasp), food, drugs, and ivy poisoning.  \\n \\nSince an allergic reac tion may also involve other auto\\ncoids such as PAF, \\nPGs, leukotriene, etc., antihistamines are not useful in controlling all types of \\nallergic reactions. \\n2) Pre-Anaesthetic Medication:  The sedative and anticholinergic action s of \\npromethazine render it useful in children. \\n', 'link': []}, 122: {'text': '122 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n3) Sedative, Hypnotic , and Anxiolytic: Antihistamines ( e.g., phenergans) \\ndepress the CNS, and can be used as sedative agents and for inducing sleep \\n(especially in children). Another antihistaminic agent, hydroxyzine is used \\nto treat anxiety as a result of autonomic manifestation. \\n4) Parkinsonism: The sedative and anticholinergic action of promethazine can \\nbe used to provide some relief in Parkinsonism. \\n5) Vertigo: It is a condition associated with loss of balance in an individual\\n, \\nthus the individual has a feeling that his surroundings are in a state of motion. \\nThis feeling is enhanced in motion sickness. Cinnarizine acts by controlling \\nthe movement of Ca2+ ions and is useful in treating vertigo. \\n6) Motion Sickness:  Antihistamines ( e.g., ethanolamines, piperazines , and \\nphenothiazines) are useful in motion sickness to relieve nausea, vomiting\\n, \\nand vertigo when given prophylactically atleast one hour before the start of \\nthe journey. They are also effective in drug\\n-induced and post -operative \\nvomiting, radiation sickness, and morning sickness. \\n7) Other Conditions: Antihistamines are also used as an ing redient in cough \\nsyrups for treating common cold. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\n1) CNS: In addition to producing adverse effects like\\n sedation, lack of \\nconcentration, fatigue, and a tendency to fall asleep, antihistamines also \\naccelerate the effect of other sedatives \\n(like alcohol and tranquilisers\\n). \\nHence, after consuming antihistamines, patients are advised not to drive or \\nwork on machines. \\n2) Anti-Muscarinic Effect:  As a result of the anticholinergic effects of \\nantihistamines, dryness of mouth and nose and blurred vision m\\nay be \\nexperienced by the patient. \\n3) CVS: Antihistamines result in hypotension and palpitations. \\n4) Teratogenic Effects: Administration of some antihistamines (e.g., cyclizine \\nand meclizine) should be avoided during pregnancy as they possess \\nteratogenic effects. \\n5) Overdose Effects:  Central excitation, tremors, convulsions, flushing, and \\nhypotension result from acute overdose of antihistamines. Respiratory and \\ncardiovascular failure results in death. \\n \\nRecently synthesised compounds ( e.g, acrivastine, levocetirizine, desloratadine, \\nterfenadine, astemizole, and lorata dine) are pure H 1 antihistamines. Since these \\ncompounds do not undergo absorption in the brain, CNS is not adversely \\naffected, and the anticholinergic effects also do not occur. However\\n, some of \\nthese new H1 antihistamines are contraindicated in pregnant and lactating women \\nas well as in hypersensitivity conditions. \\n \\n4.1.4.2. \\nH2-Antagonists \\nCimetidine was the first agent to be clinically used as an H\\n2 blocker.

Thus, a decrease in the secretion of H+ ions into the lumen is \\nseen which in turn decreases the detrimental effects of the acid on mucosal lining.\\n \\n \\nPharmacological Actions \\n1) Gastric Secretions: The principle function of H2 receptor antagonists is to block \\nthe pepsin and gastric acid secretions induced by histamine, gastrin, cholinergic \\neffect, and food. Thus, they effectively potentiate peptic ulcer healing. However, \\nother secretions or gastric and oesophageal motility is not affected by them.\\n \\n2) Other Actions: H2 receptor antagonists do not affect H 1 receptors. The drug \\nmetabolising enzymes in liver are inhibited by cimetidine. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses \\n1) Gastric Hyperacidity:  Conditions like  hyperacidity, gastric ulcers, and \\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome can be treated using H2 receptor antagonists. \\n2) Other Conditions:  Conditions of  reflux oesophagitis, stress ulcers, and \\nleukaemia associated with high levels of histamine in the blood can be \\ntreated using H2 receptor antagonists. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nCimetidine results in gynaecomastia, impotency in males, and drug interaction\\n; \\nwhile other H 2 receptor a ntagonistic agents are less toxic. However , they may \\nresult in CNS effects (headache and dizziness) and GIT effects (constipation, \\nnausea, arthralgia, and vomiting). \\n \\n4.1.4.3. \\nH3 Antagonists \\nThioperamide and clobenpropit have been identified as H3 receptor antagonists. \\nHowever, the usefulness of these agents is still not clear. \\n \\nH3 receptors are present pre-synaptically in the cerebral histaminergic neurons . \\nH3 antagonists (inverse agonists) \\nare used potentially in neur\\nopsychiatry \\n(especially in cognition impairment)  because they help in improving attention \\nand learning -wakefulness, and also in convulsions without producing sedative \\neffect. H 3 receptors reduce the release of histamine (induced by gastrin) in \\nenterochromaffin cells of stomach. This is a minor action which results in \\nreduced acid secretion.  \\n \\nThe α-methyl histamine is a selective agonist ; while thioperamide, clobenpropit, \\nciproxifan, and proxyfan are the antagonists.

It acts as the \\nprecursor of 5 -HT, which also controls feeling and mood in humans and is also \\npresent in plants (fruits and nuts). \\n \\nThe majority (approximately 80%) of serotonin in the human body is present in \\nthe enterochromaffin cells of gut and regulates the intestinal m\\novements. \\nSynthesis of the remaining 20% of serotonin takes place in the serotonergic \\nneurons in CNS where it performs numerous functions like regulation of mood, \\nappetite, sleep, muscle contraction, and some cognitive functions like memory \\nand learning.

The transporter also helps the platelets to obtain 5\\n-HT \\nfrom the blood, since platelets do n\\not possess the enzymes required for 5\\n-HT \\nsynthesis.  \\n \\n5-HT (serotonin) is metabolised by oxidative deamination by Monoamine Oxidase \\n(MAO).

They perform the function of an auto-receptor on somatodendritic \\nneurons, and is also responsible for the activation of receptor\\n-operated \\nK+ ion channel and reduction of voltage\\n-gated Ca ++ ion channels via  \\npertussis toxin-sensitive G/G0 family of G proteins. \\nii) 5-HT1B or 5-HT1D\\uf062: These receptors perform  the function of an auto -\\nreceptor in the subiculum and substantia nigra. \\niii) 5-HT1D: These receptors are expressed in large quantities as auto-receptors \\nin substantia nigra and basal ganglia on \\naxon terminals. The firing of \\ndopamine neurons and release of dopamine is regulated by these receptors. \\niv) 5-HT1E: These receptors are located in the cortex and the striatum. \\nv) 5-HT1F or 5-HT1E\\uf062: These receptors are found in the brain and periphery. \\n2) 5-HT2: The three sub-types of 5-HT2 receptors are associated with the generation \\npathway of diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3 (resulting in release of intracellular \\ncalcium) via pertussis toxin-insensitive GQ/G11 family of G-proteins: \\ni) 5-HT2A: These receptors are  present in the prefrontal, parietal and\\n \\nsensory cortex, platelets, and smooth muscles of GIT in large amounts. \\nii) 5-HT2B: These receptors were initially discovered in stomach fundus, but \\nin the brain they are found in large quantities. \\niii) 5-HT2C: These receptors are  located in the choroid plexus (epi thelium \\nthat secretes CSF) and regulate feeding as well as seizures. \\n3) 5-HT3: These receptors are present on the parasympathetic terminals in GIT \\n(vagus and splanchnic nerves) and in the solitary tract nucleus and area \\npostrema in CNS.

When agonists activate the receptor to open the ion \\nchannel, they bring about emesis, and 5-HT3 antagonists are anti-emetics. \\n4) 5-HT4: These receptors show a wide distribution throughout the body.\\n In \\nCNS, they are located in the hippocampus, superior and inferior colliculi. In \\nGIT, myenteric plexus and smooth muscle secretory cells show the presence \\nof these receptors. In GIT, they are responsible for the peristaltic activity and \\nincreased secretion (prokinesis) through signalling via G\\n5 activation of \\nadenylyl cyclase (\\uf0adcAMP). \\n5) 5-HT5A,B: These receptors are located in the hippocampus and striatum in the \\nbrain. Their function is not yet established. \\n6) 5-HT6 and 5 -HT7: These receptors are responsible for the relaxation of \\nsmooth muscles in GIT and vessels via cAMP.

When 5-HT is \\nadministered by intracoronary route\\n, vasodilation occurs  in normal \\ncoronary vessels and vasoconstriction in case of damaged vessels. 5-HT \\nconstricts veins and induces venous thromboses and promotes platelet \\naggregation, which results in enhanced capillary permeability. \\nii) Action on Heart: 5-HT binds to 5-HT4 receptor and stimulates positive \\nchronotropic action and generates certain rhythm disorders. A positive \\ninotropic effect is also seen. \\niii) Action on Blood Pressure: Action of 5 -HT on blood pressure is ve ry \\ncomplex; it may either cause\\n hypotension or hypertension or no \\nmodification. \\n2) Action on Smooth Muscles: 5-HT stimulates the contractions of intestine, \\nbronchi, and uterus: \\ni) Digestive Effects \\na) In humans, 5-HT elevates intestinal motility through stimulation of \\n5-HT4 and 5 -HT3 receptors. Upon intravenous administration, it \\nraises duodenum and small intestine motility, \\nand diarrhoea may \\noccur in carcinoid syndrome patients. \\nb) 5-HT induces emesis by stimulation of 5\\n-HT3 receptors. 5 -HT3 \\nreceptors are present on the va gal terminations in the digestive tract \\n', 'link': []}, 128: {'text': '128 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nand in area postrema (chemoreceptor trigger zone). Upon stimulation \\nof these receptors , nausea and vomiting \\nare precipitated; 5 -HT3 \\nantagonists are used in the prevention of vomiting induced during \\nantineoplastic treatments. \\nc) High dose of 5-HT in animals causes gastric ulcerations.  \\nii) Bronchial Effect: \\n5-HT causes bronchial constriction. Aerosol \\npreparations of 5-HT may cause dyspnoea.  \\niii) Uterus Effect: 5-HT induces uterine contraction. \\n3) CNS Effect: 5-HT causes many complex  effects on the CNS; these effects  \\nare very important as various drugs act by its intermediary. \\n5-HT regulates \\nsleep, mood (antidepressant action), temperature, \\nand appetite (appetite \\nsuppressant effect).  \\n \\nBoth productive and negative symptoms of psychoti\\nc disorders are \\nprecipitated on over -stimulation of 5 -HT2 receptors. Agonist of 5\\n-HT2 \\nreceptors, LSD or lysergide compounds, and also of D1 and D2 dopaminergic \\nreceptors show hallucinogenic properties. \\n4) Other Actions: 5-HT is responsible in many other condi tions like allergic \\nreactions, inflammatory reactions, and other diseases: \\ni) Carcinoid Syndrome: Metastatic tumours of enterochromaffin cells in \\nGIT ( secrete 5-HT) causes carcinoid syndrome. It is characterised by \\ndiarrhoea, flushes (cutaneous vasodilation followed by vasoconstriction), \\ndyspnoea, and sometimes damage to cardiac valves. This tumour is \\ndiagnosed by increased blood concentration of \\n5-HT which excrete \\nabnormal amounts of 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) in urines. \\nii) Migraine: It is repeated, sev\\nere headache in which vasomotor \\nphenomena and 5 -HT are involved actively. During the first prodromic \\nphase, vasoconstriction of brain vessels is followed by second painful \\nphase of vasodilation. Drugs causing vasoconstriction are used to \\ndecrease this vasodilation.  \\niii) Myocardial Ischemia: \\n5-HT released from the platelets causes \\nvasoconstriction and worsens the myocardial ischemic conditions.  \\n \\n4.1.5.5. \\n5-HT Agonists \\nFollowing are the examples of 5-HT agonists:  \\n1) Triptans: Almotriptan, sumatriptan, eletriptan, rizatriptan, naratri\\nptan, \\nfrovatriptan and zolmitri ptan are the examples of tryptans used to treat the \\nsevere attacks. Dihydroergotamine and ergotamine are used for prevention of \\nmigraine episodes and an acute attack. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nTryptans, ergot alkaloids , and antidepressants activate 5 -HT1B and 5 -HTD \\nreceptors on presynaptic trigeminal nerve endings. This inhibits the release of \\nvasodilating peptides (like CGRP and substance P) and also the neurogenic \\ninflammation around blood vessels. Nociceptive transmission in the brain \\n', 'link': []}, 129: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n129 \\n*  \\n* \\nstem trige minal nucleus is decreased by t\\nryptans, thus reducing central \\nsensitivity. These agents oppose\\n the vasodilatation , are involved  in the \\npathophysiology of migraine attacks\\n, and cause vasoconstriction.  They \\ndecrease pain and other symptoms (\\ne.g., nausea) due to acute attacks of \\nmigraine by deactivating central tryptaminergic system. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nTryptans cause coronary artery spasm, transient myocardial ischemia, \\nand \\natrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac adverse events are seen in patients \\nsuffering from corona ry risk factors. Few minor side \\neffects (e.g., tingling \\nand paraesthesia, asthenia, fatigue, flushing, pain in the chest, neck and jaw, \\ndizziness, nausea, and sweating) may also occur. \\n2) Buspirone: It is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and is a non\\n-benzodiazepine \\nantianxiety drug which does not have any sedative effects. It blocks neuronal \\nfiring in the hippocampus (where agonist of 5-HT1A receptors is present). \\n3) Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): An example of SSRIs is \\nfluoxetine that enhances and prolongs the 5-HT action by neuronal activity. \\nThese are the most effective antidepressant drugs used for depressive \\npsychosis. These agents have very less chances of adverse effects.  \\n4) Fenfluramine and Dexfenfluramine: These also suppress appetite and \\nhence manage obesity. \\nThese drugs  are halogenated amphetamines that \\nenhance 5-HT release in CNS. Therefore\\n, act as appetite suppressants \\n(similar to amphetamine and dextramphetamine). \\n5) Cisapride and Mosapride:  These are 5 -HT4 receptor agonists , used as \\nprokinetic drugs that promote GI motility. \\n \\n4.1.6. \\n5-HT Antagonists \\nThe 5-HT antagonists are used to obstruct the actions of 5 -HT receptors. Some \\nexamples of these drugs are:  \\n1) Cyproheptadine: It has a potent H 1 receptor and 5 -HT2A receptor blocking \\nactions. It also has a weak anticholinergic activity and imparts mild CNS \\ndepressant actions. It also has antipruritic activity and blocks H1 receptors. \\nIt is used in the treatment of sev\\neral skin allergies , like pruritu s and \\nurticaria. Cyproheptadine is also\\n used in  post-gastrectomy dumping \\nsyndrome, migraine prophylaxis , and carcinoid tumour. Like other H\\n1 \\nreceptor antagonists, it also causes drowsiness and sedation. \\n2) Ketanserin: It is an effective, non-selective \\uf0611-receptor blocker and does not \\nhave any effect on H 1 receptors. It blocks 5 -HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. It \\nantagonises platelet aggregation by blocking 5 -HT2 receptors on platelets. It \\ncauses vasodilation resulting \\nin decreased s ystemic blood pressure and \\nincreased blood supply to peripheral tissues. \\n3) Ritanserin: It is a 5 -HT2A antagonist with very minor affinity for \\n\\uf0611-\\nreceptors. It does not have any specific action on vasodilatation. It improves \\nsleep in narcolepsy. It is effective in manic depressive psychosis.  \\n', 'link': []}, 130: {'text': '130 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n4) Ondansetron: It is a 5 -HT3 receptor antagonist. Ondansetron derivatives \\n(e.g., granisetron and dolasetron) are used to prevent and control nausea and \\nvomiting associated with many clinical conditions (cancer chemotherapy and \\nradiation therapy). \\n5) Clozapine: It is a 5 -HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist. It is  used to treat \\nschizophrenia and does not precipitate  extrapyramidal effects as in classical \\nantipsychotics.  \\n6) Risperidone: It is more effective in management of schizop hrenia due to its \\nadditional D 1 receptor blocking activity apart from blockade of 5 -HT2A and \\n5-HT2C receptors.  \\n7) Methysergide: Chemically, it is a congener of methylergonovine, and blocks \\n5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. It obstructs vasoconstrictor effect of 5-HT and \\nalso the 5-HT actions on extravascular smooth muscle\\ns. However, it is \\nderivative of an ergot derivative, but has very\\n less vasoconstrictor and \\noxytocic activity. Methysergide is effective in the prophylactic treatment of \\nmigraine and cluster headac hes. It is also used to treat carcinoid tumour to \\ncontrol diarrhoea and malabsorption.  \\n \\n4.1.7. \\nProstaglandins (PGs) \\nProstaglandins form a group of structurally-related lipid compounds and perform \\nmany important functions in animal s. The te rm prostaglandin is derived from \\nprostate gland (their first site of origin). They are derived from fatty acids by \\nenzymatic reactions, each with potent and specific biological actions.  \\n \\nProstaglandins are physiologically effective as they can regulate th e contraction \\nand relaxation of smooth muscles. They are not hormones, but are locally acting \\nmessenger molecules, i.e., autocrines or paracrines. They exert their effect on \\nGIT, uterus, platelets, vascular endothelium, and mast cells.\\n Chemically, a \\nprostaglandin has 20 carbon atoms including a 5-carbon ring (cyclopentane ring), \\na carboxylic acid, and a 15-hydroxyl group.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPG1, PG 2, and PG 3 are the three major sub -series into which prostaglandins are \\ndivided. Number of double bonds in the particul ar molecule is indicated by the \\nsubscript number.  The PG 2 series is found predominantly as they are directly \\nderived from arachidonic acid ( an eicosatetra enoic acid ). The PG 1 series are \\nderivatives of an arachidonic acid precursor, i.e., Di\\n-homo-\\uf067-linoleic acid \\n(DHGLA) and eicosatetraenoic acid. The PG\\n3 series are derivatives of \\nEicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA). Therefore, prostaglandins are obtained from three \\nsources. Several prostaglandins are used therapeutically. \\n', 'link': []}, 131: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n131 \\n*  \\n* \\n4.1.7.1. \\nSynthesis \\nThe biosynthetic pathway of prostaglandins is depicted in figure 4.2: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n4.1.7.2. \\nPharmacological Actions \\nVarious types of PGs bind to their respective receptors (oppos ite to each other) \\nand produce related actions in tissues  and sites where they are released due to \\ninflammation, pain, trauma, allergic reactions, and bacterial attack. \\n \\nThe major pharmacological actions produced by prostaglandins are: \\n1) CVS: Vasodilatation and fall in blood pressure are caused by intravenously \\ninjected PGE2\\uf061, PGF2%, and PGI2 (stronger than acetylcholine and histamine). \\nThromboxane A2 produces vasoconstriction, but the actions are non-uniform. \\n2) Platelets: Platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction are\\n caused by \\nthromboxane A 2, whereas PGI\\n2 prevents platelet aggregation and causes \\nvasodilatation. Thromboxane synthesis and haemostasis is interfered by \\naspirin, which inhibits platelet aggregation. Since nucleus is absent in platelets, \\nthey cannot synthesise COX, and haemostasis occurs by only fresh platelets. \\n3) Bronchial Muscle s: PGF2\\uf061, PGD\\n2, and \\nthromboxaneA2 are potent \\nbronchoconstrictors, while PGE2 is a strong bronchodilator. But aspirin is not \\neffective in asthma because it is mediated by many biologica\\nlly active \\nconstituents. An imbalance between the constrictor and dilator PGs may also \\nbe the cause of asthma. \\n4) Reproductive System:  During the early stages of pregnancy\\n, uterus \\ncontraction is brought about by PGE 2 and PGF2\\uf061 as the sensitivity of uterus \\ntowards PGs is more than towards oxytocin. Dysmenorrhoea pain is the \\ncause of increased PG synthesis; therefore, this type of pain can be relieved \\nby aspirin-like drugs.  \\n \\nThe transport of sperm, fertilis ation, and initiation and progression of labour \\nare also facilitated by PGs. During the delivery of baby, the PGs cause the \\ndilation of the uterine cervix. PGs also cause regression of corpus luteum and \\nreduce progesterone secretion. \\nCell wall phospholipids \\nPhospholipase A2 \\uf0ac Corticosteroid inhibit \\nArachidonic acid \\nNSAID \\ninhibit \\nCyclooxygenase \\nI and II \\nLipoxygenase \\nHydroxy acid of arachidonic acid \\nCyclic endo peroxides \\nLeukotrienes \\nProstaglandins PGE2, \\nPGF2, and PGD2 \\nFigure 4.2: Biosynthetic Pathway of PGs \\n', 'link': []}, 132: {'text': '132 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n5) GIT: Few PGs can cause diarrhoea by increasing the propulsive activity. \\nPGE2 decreases gastric acid secretion, thus result  in the loss of protective \\neffect of GIT. This loss is the cause of the ulcerogenic action of NSAIDs. \\n6) Kidneys: Blood flow and tubular re -absorption is regulat ed by PGs. They \\ncause vasodila tion, increased blood flow, and diuresis. TAX 2 causes renal \\nvasoconstriction, while increase in release of renin is caused by PGI 2, PGE2, \\nand PGD2. \\n7) Inflammation: PGs are also involved in inflammation, as most of the \\nsymptoms, e.g., redness, pain, colour (due to increased vascul\\narity), and \\nswelling (due to increased capillary permeability) are explained by PGs. \\nTherefore, the synthesis of PGs and inflammation are reduced by aspirin and \\nother NSAIDs. \\n8) Other Actions: ANS, endocrine system, and peripheral nerves are also diversely \\naffected by PGs. They also sensitise afferent nerve endings and induces pain \\nstimuli. PGEs exert insulin-like action and causes calcium metabolism. \\n \\n4.1.7.3. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nProstaglandins have the following therapeutic uses: \\n1) Induction of Labour and Abortion: PGs are used for inducing labour in \\nthose women who cannot administer oxytocin. They also induce early and \\nmid-term abortion in women who are insensitive to oxytocin. PGF\\n2\\uf061 (e.g., \\nDinoprost, 40mg dose), 15-methyl PGF2\\uf061 (e.g., Carboprost), and PGE2 (e.g., \\nDinoprostone, 20mg) are the preparations of PGs injected intravenously. \\nHowever, in the present time vaginal gel and vaginal tablets are available \\nwhich are given via intra-vaginal route. \\n2) Peptic Ulcers: PGF2\\uf061 and PGI 2 are taken via oral route for treating gastric  \\nulcers. PGI 1 (e.g., misoprostol, 200 \\uf06dg; rioprostil, 150 \\uf06dg) and PGE 2 (e.g., \\nenprostil, 35\\uf06dg) are the preparations used in peptic ulcer. \\n3) Asthma: Some types of PGE2 can also be used for treating asthma. \\n4) CVS: PGs are also used in hypertension to inhibit the d amage of platelets in \\nblood to reduce infarct size and peripheral vascular diseases. Epoprostenol \\n(PGI2) and cicaprost are the preparations used in these conditions. \\n \\n4.1.7.4. \\nAdverse Effects \\nDose and ro ute of administration determine\\n the occurrence and severity of\\n \\nadverse effe cts which is highest with intra\\nvenous administration. The most \\nfrequently occurring adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, flushing, \\nheadache, dizziness, and hypotension. \\nWhile the adverse effects \\noccurring \\nrarely are cardiovascular collapse and convulsions.  The initiation of labour pain \\nmay lead to foetal distress, foetal death, and uterine rupture.  \\n \\n4.1.7.5. \\nProstaglandin Agonists \\nThe stable, long acting and specific synthetic analogues of PG s are widely used \\nfor their clinical applications. PGs along with their analogues are responsible for \\nstimulation of uterus, vasodilation, antiplatelet aggregation, and inhibition of \\n', 'link': []}, 133: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n133 \\n*  \\n* \\ngastric secretion. However, their use is being restricted due to the wide  range of \\nadverse effects produced by their actions on the physiological system.  Examples \\nof some synthetic prostaglandins:  \\n1) Dinoprost: It is  an exogenous PGF2\\n\\uf061 and has vasoconstrictor and \\nbronchoconstrictor properties. It is used for terminating pregnancy\\n because \\nof its ability to induce uterus contractions irrespective of the pregnancy stage. \\n \\nAdverse Effects: The most frequently occurring adverse effects are nausea, \\nvomiting, diarrhoea, flushing, headache, dizziness, and hypotension. The \\ninitiation of labour pain may lead to foetal distress, foetal death, and uterine \\nrupture.  \\n \\nIt should not be used in patients who have gone through a caesarean section, \\nmajor uterine surgery, or cephalopelvic uterine contractions. \\n2) Misoprostol: It is  a synthetic analogue o f PGE 1 and is cytoprotective. It \\ninhibits gastric acid secretion, t hus is used for treating peptic ulcer and \\nprophylaxis of ulcers induced by NSAIDs. \\n \\nAdverse Effects: Diarrhoea and uterine contractions are the most common \\nadverse effects associated with misoprostol. \\n3) Alprostadil: It is an exogenous form of PGE\\n1 and is used to keep ductus \\narteriosus patent (PDA), in children suffering from congenital heart disease \\nwith ductus -dependent flow till surgery is undertaken. Peripheral vascular \\ndisease and erectile dysfunction are also treated using alprostadil. \\n4) Gemeprost: It is a synthetic analogue of alprostadil and is available in the \\nform of 1mg vaginal pessaries. It is used for softening and dilating the cervix. \\nIt is also recommended for terminating pregnancy in the first and the second \\ntrimester. The cervix in the first trimester is softened by inserting one \\npessary, 3 hours before trying dilatation.  \\nThe pregnancy in the second trimester is terminated by inserting one pessary \\nevery hour with a maximum of five doses. Its local actions are more common \\nthan the systemic side effects as it is used locally. \\n5) Carboprost: It is an oxytocic agent and a synthetic analogue of dinoprost \\nwith a more prolonged action. It efficiently arrests intractable atonic \\npostpartum hae morrhage. It is also involved in stimulation of the gravid \\nuterus, which in turn results in myometrial contractions (similar to labour \\ncontractions at the end of full -term pregnancy). This leads to the removal of \\nthe embryo from the uterus. \\n \\nCarboprost has the following therapeutic uses:  \\ni) It controls postpartum haemorrhage due to uterine atony.  \\nii) It terminates life-threatening bleeding.  \\niii) It controls Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH). \\niv) It also causes Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) between the 13th \\nand 20th week in case of missed abortion or intra-uterine foetal death. \\n', 'link': []}, 134: {'text': '134 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\n6) Trimoprostil and Arbaprostil: \\nThese are  the synthetic analogues of \\ndinoprostone (PGE2) and inhibit gastric acid secretion. Their actions and uses \\nare similar to misoprostol. \\n7) Epoproste nol: It i s an exogenous form of PGI\\n2 (prostacyclin) and is \\ninvolved in vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregati\\non during \\ncardiac bypass, haemo\\nperfusion, and haemodialysis. It is also used in \\nperipheral vascular disease and a few disorders induced by thromb\\nosis \\nformation.

Nausea, vomiting, \\nhyperglycaemia, chest pain, and drowsiness are the other side effects. \\n \\n4.1.7.6. \\nProstaglandin Antagonists \\nProstaglandins do not have any effective potent antagonist. However, some \\ninhibitors of PG synthetase are: \\n1) Glucocorticoids: The biosynthesis of prostaglandins and related compounds \\nare blocked by glucocorticoids. This occurs as they act on phospholipase A\\n2 \\nto prevent arachidonic acid liberation required for PGs synthesis. \\n2) NSAIDs: The synthesis of PGs and thromboxanes are inhibit ed by aspirin \\nand related agents. Their ability to reduce PG synthesis marks their \\ntherapeutic value. Most of the NSAIDs are non -selective COX-1 and COX-2 \\ninhibitors; however, some are selective COX-2 inhibitors. \\n \\n4.1.8. \\nThromboxanes \\nThromboxanes are formed by the action of thromboxane synthase on PGH\\n2. \\nThromboxaneA2 (TXA2) is a platelet aggregator and a vasoconstrictor. Drugs like \\naspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, abciximab , and dipyridamole are antagonists to \\nTXA2, as they involve different mechanisms for inhibiting platelet aggregation. \\n \\n4.1.8.1. \\nSynthesis \\nThe arachidonic acid derivative, i.e., \\nPGH2 is converted to thromboxane by \\nthromboxane-A synthase present in platelets. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nArachidonic acid \\nCyclooxygenase  \\nEndoperoxides \\n(PGG2, PGH2)  \\nThromboxane \\nsynthetase    \\nThromboxane A2 \\n \\nProstacyclin (PGl2)  \\n \\nProstacyclin \\nsynthetase  \\n \\nThromboxane B2 \\n(Platelets) \\n \\n \\n6 keto PGF1\\uf061 \\n(Endothelial cells) \\n \\n \\n', 'link': []}, 135: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n135 \\n*  \\n* \\n4.1.8.2. \\nMechanism of Action \\nIn order to produce its action, thromboxane binds to thromboxane receptors.  \\nThromboxane receptors are G-protein coupled receptors coupled to the G-protein, \\nGq. The mechanism of thromboxane secretion from platelets is still unclear. \\n \\n4.1.8.3. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThromboxanes have the following therapeutic uses: \\n1) They are potent vasoconstrictor and hypertensive agents. \\n2) They assist in platelet aggregation. \\n3) In the circulatory system\\n, they control homeostatic balance along\\n with \\nprostacyclin.  \\n \\n4.1.9. \\nLeukotrienes (LTs)  \\nThe 5-lipooxygenase enzyme acts on AA to form LTA4, which gets converted to \\nLTB4 (the dihydroxy der ivative) or LTC 4 by conjugation with glutathione. The \\nglutathione moiety of the product undergoes degradation t o obtain LTD 4. LTC4 \\nand LTD 4 are potent bronchoconstrictors and are the primary components of \\nSRS-A (Slow-Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis). \\n \\nIn the tre atment of bronchial asthma, Zile uton (the lipoxygenase inhibitor), and \\nzafirlukast and montelukast (t he LTD4 receptor antagonists) are used. LTA 4\\n (the \\nprimary product of 5 -LOX) is converted to lipoxins via 12-LOX present in the \\nplatelets. LXA4 and LXB4 are the two lipoxins, which are significant in the \\nresolution of the inflammatory response, affecting all cell-mediated inflammatory \\nresponses. \\n \\n4.1.9.1. \\nTypes \\nLTA4, LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, and LTF 4 are some examples of leukotrienes. \\nLTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are referred to as cysteinyl leukotrienes, because amino \\nacid cysteines are present i n their structure. The cysteinyl leukotrienes make up \\nthe SRS-A. \\n \\nIn LTG4 (a metabolite of LTE 4), the cysteinyl moiety has been oxidised to an α-\\nketo-acid (i.e., the cysteine has been replaced \\nwith a pyruvate). Very limited \\ninformation is available about this putative leukotriene. \\n \\n4.1.9.2. \\nSynthesis \\nThe synthesis of leukotri\\nenes in cells occurs from arachidonic acid by 5\\n-\\nlipoxygenase. This catalytic mechanism occurs by the insertion of an oxygen \\natom at a specific position of the arachidonic acid backbone. \\n \\nThe lipoxygenase pathway is active in leukocytes, mast cells, eosinop\\nhils, \\nneutrophils, basophils , and monocytes. Activation of these cells results in the \\nrelease of arachidonic acid from cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipase \\nA2, and donated to 5\\n-lipoxygenase by the 5 -Lipoxygenase-Activating Protein \\n(FLAP). \\n', 'link': []}, 136: {'text': '136 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nFLAP is used by 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) for the conversion of arachidonic acid \\ninto 5 -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5\\n-HPETE), which  reduces to 5\\n-\\nhydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid   (5-HETE) spontaneously. This reduced 5-HETE is \\nagain acted upon by the enzyme 5 -LO to get converted into LTA 4 (an unstable \\nepoxide). In neutrophils and monocytes (cells containing LTA 4 hydrolase), LTA4 \\nis converted to LTB4 (dihydroxy acid leukotriene). \\n \\nIn mast cells and eosinophils (cells containing LTC4 synthase), LTA4 forms LTC4 \\n(first o f the cysteinyl -leukotrienes) by conjugation with tripeptide glutathione. \\nLTC4 forms LTD4; and LTE4 outside the cell by ubiquitous enzymes for retaining \\nthe biological activity. \\n \\nThe cell surface receptors (CysLT1 and CysLT2) present on target ce lls are acted \\nupon by cysteinyl leukotrienes, which cause\\n bronchial and vascular smooth \\nmuscle contraction for enhancing the permeability of small blood vessels.  \\n \\nThis also results in increased mucus secretion in the airway and gut and \\nleukocytes are released at th\\ne inflammation sites. The cysteinyl\\n-leukotrienes \\n(LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) and LTB4 undergo partial degradation in local tissues, thus, \\nbecoming inactive metabolites in liver. \\n \\n4.1.9.3. \\nPharmacological Actions \\nLeukotrienes act on a sub-family of G-protein coupled receptors and may also act \\nupon peroxisome \\nproliferator-activated receptors. Asthmatic and allergic \\nreactions involve leukotrienes which sustain the inflammatory reactions. \\nAsthmatic conditions can also be\\n treated usi ng montelukast and zafirlukast\\n, \\nwhich are antagonists of leukotriene receptor. \\n \\nLeukotrienes are important in inflammatory response. Some of them exert a \\nchemotactic effect on migrating neutrophils \\n(e.g., LTB4), thus, bringing the \\nnecessary cells to the ti\\nssues. Leukotrienes are also involved in \\nbronchoconstriction, thus, enhances vascular permeability. \\n \\nThe major pharmacological effects shown by leukotrienes are: \\n1) Leukotrienes in Asthma: \\nThe pathophysiology of asthma involves \\nleukotrienes which give rise to various symptoms: \\ni) Obstruction to airflow, \\nii) Enhanced mucus secretion, \\niii) Accumulation of mucus, \\niv) Bronchoconstriction, and \\nv) Infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airway wall.  \\n2) Role of Cysteinyl Leukotrienes: \\nCysLT1 and CysLT 2 are the cysteinyl \\nleukotriene rec eptors present on endothelial cells, mast cells, and \\neosinophil s.  \\nThey stimulate pro\\n-inflammatory activities such as \\nendothelial cell adherence and chemokine production by mast cells during \\ncysteinyl leukotriene interaction.  \\n', 'link': []}, 137: {'text': 'Autocoids (Chapter 4)  \\n137 \\n*  \\n* \\n \\nSince they are inflammation mediators, they help in inducing asthma and \\nother inflammatory disorders. This reduces the airflow to alveoli.  Cysteinyl \\nleukotrienes induce anaphylactic shock when present excessively. \\n \\n4.1.9.4. \\nPathophysiological Actions \\nLeukotrienes show the following pathophysiological actions: \\n1) They are produced locally at the injury site\\n, thus act as mediators of \\ninflammation in cardiovascular and blood system.  \\n2) They are released in lungs along with prostaglandins and other autocoids as a \\nresult of antigen -antibody reaction, th us, are also the mediators of allergic \\nasthma in smooth muscles. \\n \\n4.1.10. Angiotensin (AT) \\nAngiotensin is  a potent vasopressor substance produced in plasma. It is \\ndesignated as angiotensin -II (AT -II), which is an octa peptide converted from \\nangiotensin-I (AT-I) by the Angiotensin Con\\nverting Enzyme (ACE).\\n \\nAngiotensinogen is converted to AT-I by renin, which is formed in the kidneys in \\nthe juxt aglomerular apparatus (JG apparatus). The mechanisms that regulate \\nwater and electrolyte balance, blood p ressure, and cardiac functions have renin -\\nangiotensin system as an important element. \\n \\n4.1.10.1. Angiotensin Receptors (ATRs)  \\nAngiotensin receptors (AT1 and AT2) are widely distributed and mediate the actions \\nof AT-II. The rapid onse t of action of \\nAT-II is permitted by the angiotensin \\nreceptors, which are Gq-protein coupled receptors present on the plasma membrane \\nof target cells.

Synthesis and Metabolism \\nAngiotensinogen is a plasma \\uf0612-globulin that originates from the liver. It is the \\nprecursor for all angiotensins. Comparatively inactive decapeptide angiotensin I \\nis formed when renin acts on \\nangiotensinogen. Peptidyl dipeptidase or \\nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) present in the capillary endothelial cells \\nand maximally in the pulmon ary circulation hydrolyses the obtained AT\\n-I to \\nform AT-II (a highly active octapeptide).

Pharmacological Actions of Angiotensin-II \\nAngiotensin-II acts on the  vascular smooth muscle s, adrenal cortex, kidney s, \\nheart, and brain. Through these actions, an important role is played by t he renin-\\nangiotensin system in the regulation of fluid, electrolyte b\\nalance, an d arterial \\nblood pressure. Hypertension \\nand cardiac re\\n-modelling occur due to the \\nunnecessary activation of the renin -angiotensin system.   The pharmacological \\nactions of AT-II are: \\n1) Vascular Smooth Muscle and Blood Pressure: \\nAT-II is 40 times more\\n \\npotent than nor-adrenaline (NA) on molar basis and is a potent vasoconstrictor. \\nWhen angiotensin is given via intravenous route, b\\nlood pressure elevates \\nwithin a few seconds, peaks rapidly , and returns to normal levels in a few \\nminutes. This elevation in  blood pressure is observed due to  an increase in \\nperipheral vascular resistance resulting from the fall of blood pressure.  \\n \\nAT-II mediates the pressor response by direct and indirect actions: \\ni) Direct Vasopressor Effect:\\n Constriction of  pre-capillary arteri oles \\npredominantly and that of post -capillary venules to some extent occurs \\nby the AT-II. In kidneys, direct vasoconstriction is strongest, while it is \\nless in the splanchnic vascular bed.  \\nii) Enhancement of Peripheral Noradrenergic Neurotransmission: AT-\\nII prevents nor-adrenaline uptake from the adrenergic nerve endings and \\nLiver \\nCorticosteroids,O\\nestrogen  \\nAngiotensin II \\nVasopressin \\nPlasma K+ \\nAdrenergic (\\uf062) \\nAngiotensinogen (14 AA) \\n(Plasma \\uf0612 Globulin) \\nRenin \\nJG Cells of \\nKidney  \\nPepstatin  \\nReduced B.P. \\n(Renal)  \\nAngiotensin I (10 AA) \\n(Inactive) \\nAngiotensin Converting \\nEnzyme (ACE) (Pulmonary \\ncirculation) \\nLow Plasma Na+ \\nAngiotensin II \\nreceptor \\nantagonists \\nAngiotensin II (8AA) \\nAngiotensin III (7AA) \\nAngiotensinases \\nPeptide fragments (inactive) \\n+  \\n– \\n+  \\n+  \\nAminopeptidase \\nLosartan \\nValsartan  \\nCaptopril \\nTeprotide \\nEnalapril  \\nFigure 4.3: Synthesis and Metabolism of Angiotensins, and the Drugs which Interfere with \\nthe Synthesis of Angiotensin II.

This is authenticated by \\nthe fact that the relapse of atherosclerosis decreases the presence of AT-II. It \\nseems that AT-II is produced by tissue -bound ACE within the coronary \\nplaques. \\n3) Cardiac Hypertrophy and Re-Modelling: Myocyte hypertrophy, ventricular \\ndilatation, and dysfunction in non-infarcted areas adjacent to the infarcted area \\nare the characteristics of left ventricular re-modelling after MI. Several studies \\nsuggest that ACE inhibitors are effective in weakening the \\ncardiac re -\\nmodelling after MI. Studies also show that the re -modelling process involves \\ndirect AT-II effects and indirect effects via the kallikrein-kinin system.  \\n \\nMigration, proliferation, and hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts \\nare stimulated by AT-II. By directly acting on \\nthe cardiac cells, AT-II \\ninduces the expression of specific proto\\n-oncogenes. By increasing the \\npreload (due to volume expansion ) and afterload (due to increased arterial \\npressure), AT-II also increases the cardiac workload. \\n4) Effects on Kidneys: AT-II directly  stimulates the Na+/H+ exchange and \\nincreases the re-absorption  of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate  ions. The \\nzona glomerulosa of adrenal cor tex is stimulated by  AT-II to increase the \\nsynthesis and release of aldosterone which causes retention of Na\\n+ and \\nCl– ions and water. Both these effects \\nincrease the  extracellular fluid \\nvolume.  \\n5) Effects on CNS: Along with its central effects on blood pressure, AT-II also \\nacts on the CNS for stimulating \\ndrinking and increasi ng vasopressin and \\nACTH secretion. \\n \\n4.1.10.4.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor \\nACE inhibitors  decrease the circulating levels of \\nAT-II and a ldosterone by \\ninhibiting the conversion of AT-I to AT-II. All the actions mediated by AT-II are \\nabolished by ACE inhibitors. They are pharmacologically useful in hypertension \\nand congestive heart failure related to left ventricular dysfunction.  \\n', 'link': []}, 140: {'text': '140 \\nPharmacology-II \\n*  \\n* \\nCaptopril metabolises partially but is also active in its u nchanged form.

These metabolites  are indicated by the letters ‘at’ \\nadded to the name of eac h drug, e.g., enalaprilat and ramiprilat. Lisinopril is the \\nonly ACE inhibitor that gets excreted in the urine in unchanged form as it is not \\nmetabolised and available in an active form. \\n \\nAlong with blocking the conversion of AT-I to AT-II, ACE inhibitors also inhibit \\nthe degradation of bradykin in, substance P, and enk ephalins. The metabolic \\nproducts of these substances give rise to the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors. \\n \\n4.1.10.6. Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists \\nThe actions of AT-II are inhibited at the AT\\n1 receptor by AT 1 inhibitor \\nantagonists (e.g., losartan and valsartan ). Since ACE is not the only enzyme to \\ngenerate AT-II, AT1 receptor antagonists allow complete inhibition of \\nAT-II \\naction. The AT1 receptor antagonists do not affect the metabolism of bradykinin, \\nthus, their use may reduce the occurrence of dru\\ng-induced cough and \\nangioedema.  \\n \\nBut, the AT 1 receptor antagonists produce less effective vasodilation because of \\ntheir incapability to potentiate the vasodilatory ef\\nfects of bradykinin. The AT \\nreceptor antagonists exert an indirect action to\\n increase the AT2 receptors \\nmediated vasodilatory effects. \\n \\nThe ACE inhibitors and AT 1 receptor antagonists increase the release of renin. \\nSome AT1 receptor antagonists are used for treating hypertension and some  are \\nalso used for treating heart failure. AT1 receptor antagonist along with an ACE \\ninhibitor is used for reducing the morbidity and mortality in heart failure; \\nhowever, the efficacy of this combination is yet to be establi shed by conducting \\nclinical trials.  Just like ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptors also slow the development \\nof diabetic nephropathy. \\n \\nLosartan, epro sartan, irbesartan, \\nolmesartan, candesartan, valsartan , and \\ntelmisartan are the examples of commonly used AT1 receptor antagonists. \\n \\n4.1.11. Bradykinin  \\nBradykinin exists in its inactive form in the plasma. It is \\nmade up of  \\nbradykininogen (the \\uf0612-globulin precursor) by the plasma enzyme kallikrein.  \\n \\n4.1.11.1. Synthesis and Metabolism \\nKinins are potent vasodilator polypeptides formed from \\nkininogens ( \\uf0612-\\nglobulin fraction of plasma\\n). Kallikreins are glycoproteins present in the \\nplasma, kidneys, sweat gland s, salivary gland s, intestine s, and pancreas. The \\nconversion of kini\\nnogens to bradykinin (a nonapeptide) and kallidin (a \\ndecapeptide) is catalysed by kallikreins .

These effects together decrease the \\nblood pressure rapidly and temporarily. \\n3) They cause stimulation of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. \\n4) They increase chloride transport by increasing renal blood flow.  \\n5) They are important in the inflammatory process. \\n6) They cause activation of the peripheral nerve endings that sense pain. \\n \\n4.1.11.4. Therapeutic Uses \\nThe therapeutic uses of bradykinin are: \\n1) The formation of kinins is inhibited by aprotinin (trasy\\nlol) as it inhibits \\nkallikreins. Other proteases (like plasmin) are also inhibited by aprotinin. \\n2) Aprotinin is used during cardiac bypass surgery \\ndue to its anticoagulant  \\nproperties which decrease the amount of blood required for transfusion while \\nperforming extracorporeal procedures, and in surgeries where pat ients are at \\nhigh risk for excessive bleeding. \\n3) Agents altering kinin release are being investigated for treating inflammation.\\n \\nKininogen \\nKininogen \\n(LMW) of tissues \\n(Nonapeptide) \\nAprotinin \\n(HMW) of plasma \\n(Decapeptide) \\nPlasma \\naminopeptidase \\nGlandular \\nPlasma \\nKallikrein \\nInactive products \\nKininases \\n(I and II – ACE) \\nBradykinin \\nFigure 4.4: Synthesis and Metabolism of Kinins.

Substance P \\nSubstance P is a peptide which belongs to the tachykinin family of peptides\\n. It \\nacts as a neurotransmitter in the CNS and the enteric nerve plexus. Neurokinin A \\nand neurokinin B are other members of tachykinin family.  \\n \\nThree G-protein coupled receptors ( NK1, NK2, and NK 3) mediate the actions of \\nsubstance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B. Substance P is the favoured ligand \\nfor the NK1 receptor, which is the major tachykinin receptor in the brain. \\n \\n4.1.12.1. Pharmacological Actions \\nThe pharmacological actions of substance P are: \\n1) Pain: Substance P transmits painful stimuli from the periphery to the spinal \\ncord a nd higher brain structures. It is found in afferent sensory fibres of \\ndorsal root ganglion , in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord,  and in the vagal \\nafferent fibres innervating the solitary tract nucleus and area postrema. It \\ncontrols dopamine release in st riatal neurons. It \\nis involved in anxiety, \\ndepression, behaviour, emesis, and nausea. \\n2) Cardiovascular System: Substance P causes vasodilation and hypotension \\nby releasing nitric oxide from the endothelium. \\n3) Smooth Muscle:  Substance P causes contraction of in testinal, venous and \\nbronchial smooth muscles. \\n4) Kidney: Substance P causes diuresis and natriuresis.  \\n \\n4.1.12.2. Therapeutic Uses \\nBoth substance P and n eurokinin A are involved in neurogenic inflammation. \\nThey produce smooth muscle contraction and mucous secretion by  acting on the \\nmast cells which release histamine and other mediators.  \\n \\nNeurogenic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory \\nconditions such as delayed phase of asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and \\nallergic rhinitis, etc.  \\n \\n4.1.12.3.

NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY \\nDRUGS (NSAIDS) \\n \\n5.1.1. \\nIntroduction \\nNon-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs  (NSAIDs) are used to treat \\ninflammation, mild -to-moderate pain, and fever. Specific uses include the \\ntreatment of headache, arthritis, sports injuries, and menstrual cramps. Aspirin is \\nused to inhibit the clotting of blood and prevent strokes and heart attacks in \\nindividuals at high risk. NSAIDs are also included in many cold and allergic \\npreparations.  \\n \\nThe incidence of side effects depends on the drugs. The most common side \\neffects of NSAIDs are \\nGIT disturbances, like nausea, vomiting, constipation, \\ndiarrhoea, peptic ulcer, and decreased appetit\\ne. They  may also cause fluid \\nretention which leads to oedema. The most serious side effects are liver failure, \\nkidney failure, ulcers, and continued bleeding after an injury or surgery. \\n \\nThe individuals who are allergic to NSAIDs develop breath\\nlessness on \\nadministration of NSAIDs. Asthma patients are at higher risk a\\nnd suffer from \\nsevere allergic reaction s. Reye’s syndrome \\nmay occur in \\nchildren and \\nteenagers if they have administered aspirin when suffering from \\nchicken pox \\nor influenza.  Thus, children and teenagers with suspected or confirmed \\nchicken pox \\nor influenza \\nshould not be administered with aspirin and \\nsalicylate.  \\n \\nDrugs reducing the raised body temperature are \\nantipyretics. Inflammation \\ncaused by Prostaglandin (PGE\\n2) is cured or prevented by using \\nanti-\\ninflammatory agents . These drugs are extensively used for \\nrelieving minor \\naches, fever, pains, and \\nfor symptomatic treatment of \\nrheumatoid arthritis, \\nrheumatic fever, and osteoarthritis. \\n \\n5.1.2. \\nMechanism of Action \\nNSAIDs inhibit Cycloxygenase (COX) enzyme, which catalyses the synthesis of \\ncyclic endoperoxides from arac hidonic acid to form PGs . There are two COX \\nisoenzymes, i.e., COX -1 and COX -2. PGs which are associated with normal \\ncellular activit y (protection of gastric mucosa and\\n maintenance of kidney \\nfunction) are produced by COX\\n-1, while COX-2 produces PGs at the \\ninflammation sites.  \\nCHAPTER \\n5 \\n \\n \\nNon-Steroidal Anti-\\nInflammatory Agents \\n', 'link': []}, 146: {'text': \"146 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBoth COX -1 and COX -2 with different level of selectivity \\nare inhibited by \\nNSAIDs. An elaborated mechanism of action of NSAIDs can be studied with \\nrespect to the following effects: \\n1) Anti-Inflammatory Effects: These effects of NSAIDs include:  \\ni) This effect of NSAIDs is due to the inhibition of \\nCOX enzymes that \\nproduce prostaglandin H synthase by converting arachidonic acid into \\nprostaglandins, TXA2, and prostacyclin. \\nii) Aspirin irreversibly inactivates COX -1 and COX -2 by acet ylation of a \\nspecific serine residue. This distinguishes it from other NSAIDs, which \\nreversibly inhibit COX-1 and COX-2. \\niii) NSAIDs have no effect on lipoxygenase\\n, and therefore do not inhibit \\nleukotriene production.   \\niv) Additional anti-inflammatory mechanisms may include interference with \\nthe potentiative action of other mediators of inflammation (bradykinin, \\nhistamine, and serotonin), modulation of T -cell function, stabilisation of \\nlysosomal membranes, and inhibition of chemotaxis. \\n2) Analgesic Effects: These effects of NSAIDs include: \\ni) This effect of NSAIDs is\\n related to the peripheral inhibition of \\nprostaglandin production, but it may also be due to the inhibition of pain \\nstimuli at a sub-cortical site.   \\nii) NSAIDs prevent the potentiating action of prostaglandins on endogenous \\nmediators of peripheral nerve stimulation (e.g., bradykinin). \\n3) Antipyretic Effect s: These effects of NSAIDs is related to inhibition of \\nproduction of prostaglandins induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-\\n6 (IL -6) in the hypothalamus and  the “re -setting” of the thermoregulatory \\nsystem, leading to vasodilatation and increased heat loss. \\nFigure 5.1: Differentiation of Cox Enzymes with respect to Function \\nPhysiological stimulus \\nPhysiologic Functions \\nInflammatory stimulus \\nInflammatory \\n \\nCOX-1 \\n(Constitutive)  \\nStomach, Kidney,  \\nIntestine, Platelets, Endothelium \\nInhibition by \\nNSAID \\n– \\n– \\n \\nCOX-2 \\n(Inducible) \\n Inflammatory, Sites \\n(Macrophages, Synoviocytes) \\nInflammatory PGs \\nProteases \\n\\uf02d\\n'2\\nO\\n \\nPGE2 \\nTxA2 \\nPGI2 \\n\", 'link': []}, 147: {'text': 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Chapter 5)  \\n147 \\n*  \\n* \\n5.1.3. \\nClassification \\nThe NSAIDs are classified as follows: \\n1) Non-Selective COX Inhibitors (Conventional NSAIDs) \\ni) Salicylates: Aspirin, Diflunisal, Salsalate, Sodium  salicylate, Salol, \\nSalicylamide, Benorilate, and Choline salicylate. \\nii) Pyrazolone Derivatives: Phenylbutazone and Oxyphenbutazone. \\niii) Indole Derivatives: Indomethacin and Sulindac. \\niv) Propionic Acid Derivatives:  Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Ketoprofen, \\nand \\nFlurbiprofen. \\nv) Anthranilic Acid Derivatives: Mefenamic acid. \\nvi) Aryl-Acetic Acid Derivatives: Diclofenac. \\nvii) Oxicam Derivatives: Piroxicam and Tenoxicam. \\nviii) Pyrrolo-Pyrrole Derivatives: Ketorolac. \\n2) Preferential COX-2 Inhibitors: Nimesulide, Meloxicam, and Nabumetone. \\n3) Selective COX-2 Inhibitors: Celecoxib, Rofecoxib, and Valdecoxib. \\n4) Analgesic-Antipyretics with Poor Anti-Inflammatory Action \\ni) Para-Aminophenol Derivatives: Paracetamol (Acetaminophen). \\nii) Pyrazolone Derivatives: Metamizol (Dipyrone) and Propiphenazone. \\niii) Benzoxazocine Derivatives: Nefopam. \\n \\n5.1.4. \\nSalicylates - Aspirin \\nFor nearly 200 years aspirin is in use for clinical purposes. Earlier it was derived \\nfrom willow bark but now it is synthesised. \\n \\n5.1.4.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin are exerted by \\nthe acetyl and the salicylate portions of the intact molecule as well by the active \\nsalicylate metabolite. Aspirin directly and irreversibly inhibits the activity of \\nCOX-1 and COX-2 to decrease the formation of precursors of prostaglandins and \\nthromboxanes from arachidonic acid. This makes aspirin different from other \\nNSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen) which are reversible inhibitors. \\nSalicylate may competitively in\\nhibit prostaglandin formation. Aspirin’s anti\\n-\\nrheumatic (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) actions are a result of its analgesic \\nand anti-inflammatory mechanisms. \\n \\n5.1.4.2. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nAspirin on oral administration is absorbed quickly, mostly from the upper part of \\nsmall intestine (due to large surface area and also \\nwhere the drug is mostly \\nionised) and partly from the stomach (where the drug is moslty unionised). After \\nabsorption, aspirin rapidly hydrolyses  into acetic acid and salicylate  bound to \\nplasma prote ins (especially albumin ). However, the unbound fraction of \\nsalicylate increases \\nwith the increase in \\nserum concentration. \\nSalicylate \\nbiotransformation increases in the mitochondria and hepatic endoplasmic \\nreticulum. Salicylate formed by hydrolysing aspirin can be excreted as such or as \\nwater-soluble conjugates like ether, salicyluric acid (the glycine conjugate), or \\n', 'link': []}, 148: {'text': '148 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nphenolic glucuronide, which are then excreted by kidneys. Within 1-2 hours peak \\nplasma levels are reached and the serum half -life of aspirin is 3-5 hours. In high \\ndoses (4gm/day) however, the half-life of aspirin increases to 15 hours or more. \\nHence, aspirin metabolises following first-order kinetics when given in low doses \\n(600mg) and changes to zero -order kinetics at higher doses. This effect t akes a \\nweek as the hepatic enzymes metabolising salicylate are saturated. \\n \\n5.1.4.3. \\nPharmacological Actions \\nThe pharmacological actions of aspirin are given below: \\n1) Anti-Inflammatory Action: Aspirin is a highly effective anti -inflammatory \\nagent which inhibits PG synthesis. Though, aspirin has also been found to be \\ninterfering with chemical mediators of kallikrein system, stabilising \\nlysosomes, and inhibiting the polymorphs and macrophages from migrating  \\ninto the inflammatory sites. \\n2) Analgesic Action:  Aspirin is effici\\nent in relieving non\\n-visceral pain; \\nhowever, its analgesic effect is milder  than that of codeine. The major \\nmechanism is inhibition of peripheral PG synthesis, but a central part which \\npossibly involves PGs, cannot be ignored. \\n3) Antipyretic Action: Inhibition of hypothalamic PG synthesis is associated \\nwith the antipyretic action of aspirin. It lowers the elevated body temperature \\nby sweating and peripheral vasodilatation which promotes heat loss. \\n4) Effect on Respiration: Therapeutic doses of aspirin increase CO2 production \\nthrough its metabolic effects and also stimulate the respiratory centre. The \\nrate and depth of respiration is increased by larger doses \\nof aspirin which \\ninduce direct stimulation of respiratory centre. \\nRenal loss of bicarbonates \\ncompensates the respiratory alkalosis that may develop. \\n5) Metabolic Effects:  Due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in \\nskeletal muscles, aspirin \\nincreases O2 consumption and CO\\n2 production. \\nMetabolic acidosis occurs in severe poisoning due to accumulat ion of lactic \\nand pyruvic acids. This accumulation is the result of intervention of enzymes \\nof the Kreb’s cycle and the build-up of acetoacetic acid due to increase in \\nlipid metabolism.  \\n6) Effects on Blood: \\nPGI2 inhibits and platelet TXA\\n2 induces platelet \\naggregation. G eneration of both eicosanoids is inhibited by \\naspirin in \\ntherapeutic doses, but thromboxane synthesis is \\ninhibited and endothelial \\nPGI2 levels remain unaffected by low doses of aspirin.  \\n7) Endocrine Effects: Thyroid hormones are displaced from \\nthe protein \\nbinding sites and adrenocorticoids are displaced from \\nthe plasma pro tein \\nbinding sites by aspirin. Release of a\\ndrenal steroid is increased by aspirin \\nonly in large doses. \\n8) Gastrointestinal Tract: Aspirin inhibits mucoprotective PGs, thus induces \\ngastric and intestinal erosions and haemorrhage. \\n9) Acid-Base and Electrolyte Balance: \\nThe acid-base and electrolyte \\ncomposition of body fluids \\nare changed by anti -inflammatory doses  of \\n', 'link': []}, 149: {'text': 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Chapter 5)  \\n149 \\n*  \\n* \\naspirin. At starting, respiratory stimulation dominates and \\ncontributes in \\nwashing out CO2 even with increased production \\uf0ae respiratory alkalosis that \\nis remunerated by enhanced renal excretion of \\n–3\\nHCO  (with additional Na +, \\nK+, and water). Treatment with 4 -5gm/day of aspirin  in most of the adults, \\ncauses compensated respiratory alkalosis. \\n \\nHigher doses of aspirin cause respiratory depression by retaining CO2, while still \\nproducing excess CO2 \\uf0ae respiratory acidosis. To this, dissociated salicylic acid \\nalong with metabolic acids (lactic, pyruvic, and acetoacetic) that are excessively \\nproduced, and metabolic derivatives of sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid that \\nare retained because of depressed renal function, are added. Since plasma \\n–3\\nHCO  \\nion concentration is already low, all the above mentioned factors add up to cause \\nuncompensated metabolic acidosis. Adults manifest this phase in late stages of \\npoisoning, while children manifest it during salicylate poisoning. Increased water \\nloss in urine (to accompany Na+, K+, and\\n–3\\nHCO  ions) and increased sweating and \\nhyperventilation causes dehydration during poisoning.\\n \\n \\n10) CVS: No direct effect is produced by therapeutic doses of aspirin. \\nLarger \\ndoses cause direct vasodilation by increasing cardiac output for meeting \\nincreased peripheral O 2 demand. Vasomotor  centre is depressed by toxic \\ndoses and  blood pressure declines . In patients having low cardiac reserve, \\nCHF may be precipitated due to Na + ions and water retention and increased \\ncardiac work. \\n \\n5.1.4.4. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe therapeutic uses of aspirin are given below: \\n1) As Analgesic: It is used in dysmenorrhoea, headache (including mild migraine), \\nbackache, joint pain, toothache, neuralgias, myalgia, and pulled muscle.\\n \\n2) As Antipyretic: It efficiently reduces fever in the same d\\nose as used in \\nanalgesia. But, generally paracetamol is preferred as it is much safer.  \\n3) Acute Rheumatic Fever: It is the first drug that is used in every case. When \\nit is not effective or in severe cases, other drugs can be added or substituted \\n(corticosteroids act faster).   \\n4) Rheumatoid Arthritis: 3-5gm/day dose of aspirin relieves pain, swelling , \\nand morning stiffness, but does not affect the progress of disease.  \\n5) Osteoarthritis: It only provides symptomatic relief , and paracetamol is the \\npreferred analgesic for most cases. \\n6) Post-Myocardial Infarction and Post\\n-Stroke Patients: It lowers the \\nincidence of re-infarction by inhibiting platelet aggregation. \\n \\n5.1.4.5. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe side effects of aspirin include: \\n1) Gastrointestinal Toxicity: \\nCommonest adverse effects are epigastric \\ndistress, heartburn, abdominal pain, and vomiting due to gastric erosions and \\nbleeding. Gastric toxicity can be reduced by taking aspirin with or soon after \\n', 'link': []}, 150: {'text': '150 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nmeals, combining it with sodium bicarbonate (ionisation will retard gastric \\nabsorption), enteric coated tablets (clinical effe ct is delayed), or H 2-receptor \\nblockers or proton pump inhibitors. \\n2) Salicylism: High doses or chronic use of aspirin may induce a syndrome \\ncharacterised by reversible effects like tinnitus, hearing defects, blurring of \\nvision, dizziness, headache, and mental confusion.  \\n3) Hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions include severe rhinitis, bronchospasm, \\nurticaria, angioneurotic oedema, and anaphylactic shock. \\n4) Reye’s Syndrome:  Aspirin has been implicated in the etiology of Reye’s \\nsyndrome characterised by liver damage  and encephalopathy, which occurs \\nin infants and children recovering from febrile viral infection. \\n5) Analgesic Nephropathy: Repeatedly used NSAIDs, including aspirin, may \\nrarely cause irreversible renal damage characterised by chronic interstitial \\nnephritis, papillary necrosis, and acute renal failure.  \\n6) Pregnancy: Prolonged gestation and delayed labour may occur due to \\ninhibition of uterine PG synthesis. \\n7) Aggravation of Acute Gout:\\n It occurs due to uric acid retention in \\ntherapeutic doses. \\n \\n5.1.4.6. \\nDrug Interactions \\nAspirin undergoes the following drug interactions: \\n1) Toxicity of warfarin, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, naproxen , and methotrexate \\nmay occur as aspirin displaces them from plasma protein binding sites. \\n2) It also increases the risk of bleeding in patients having or al anticoagulants \\ndue to its antiplatelet action.  \\n3) It antagonises the uricosuric action of probenecid by inhibiting tubular \\nsecretion of uric acid (at analgesic doses). \\n4) It also interferes with the tubular secretion of methotrexate. \\n5) It decreases the K + ions conserving action of spironolactone and moderates \\nthe diuretic action of furosemide and thiazides.  \\n6) It displaces thyroxine, thus reduces the protein bound iodine levels; however, \\nhypothyroidism does not occur. \\n \\n5.1.4.7. \\nContraindications \\nAspirin is contraindicated in the following cases: \\n1) It is contraindicated in peptic ulcer, bleeding tendencies, in children suffering \\nfrom chicken pox or influenza, and in patients who are sensitive to it\\n. \\nPaediatric formulations of aspirin are banned in India due to\\n the risks of \\nReye’s syndrome. \\n2) It is contraindicated in chronic liver disease as it may precipitate hepatic necrosis\\n. \\n3) It is contraindicated in patients having low cardiac  reserve or frank CHF, \\ndiabetes, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. \\n4) It should be stopped 1 week earlier to the elective surgery. \\n', 'link': []}, 151: {'text': 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Chapter 5)  \\n151 \\n*  \\n* \\n5) It is contraindicated during pregnancy as it may be accountable for low birth \\nweight babies, delayed or prolonged labour, greater postpartum blood loss\\n, \\nand premature closure of ductus arteriosus. \\n6) It is contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers. \\n7) It is contraindicated in individuals with G -6-PD deficiency as it may cause  \\nhaemolysis. \\n \\n5.1.5. \\nPyrazolone Derivatives \\nDrugs of this group include \\nPhenylbutazone, oxyphenbutaz one, and \\nazapropazone are the examples of drugs that are pyrazolone derivatives\\n. \\nGenerally, the drugs of this group are too toxic for repetitive use.\\n \\nPhenylbutazone is quickly and wholly absorbed from the GIT  and reaches the  \\npeak plasma concentration withi n 2 hours. It has a very long plasma half -life of \\n50-65 hours. Nearly 98% of this drug is bound to plasma proteins and is excreted \\nin the urine, mostly as its conjugate metabolites. \\n \\nPhenylbutazone is poorly tolerated, has around 10-45% incidence of side effects, \\nand 10 -15% patients discontinue its use . The most frequently \\noccurring side \\neffects include vomiting, nausea, skin rashes, and epigastric distress. Other side \\neffects include diarrhoea, insomnia, vertigo, nervousness, euphoria, haematuria, \\nand blur red vision. Peptic ulcer and hypersensitivity reactions such as \\nserum \\nsickness, hepatitis, ulcerative stomatitis, aplastic anaemia, leucopoenia, \\nthrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis are some serious side effects\\n. Several \\ncases of deaths  due to agranulocyt osis and aplastic anaemia have been seen\\n \\nassociated with this drug.   \\n \\nOxyphenbutazone (a metabolite and analogue of phenylbutazone ) has the same \\nrange of activity, therapeutic uses, and toxicity as its parent compound. \\n \\n5.1.6. \\nIndole Derivatives - Indomethacin \\nIndomethacin is a methylated indole derivative which is more toxic\\n; however, \\nunder certain conditions it is more effective than aspirin or other NSAIDs. It is a \\nbetter cyclooxygenase inhibitor than aspirin, but due to patient intolerance it  is \\nused for short-term therapy.   \\n \\n5.1.6.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nIndomethacin is a prostaglandin G/H synthase (cyclooxygenase or COX) inhibitor \\nwhich acts on prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and -2). Conversion of \\narachidonic acid to prostaglandins that cause fever, pain, swelling, inflammation, \\nand platelet aggregation is catalysed by prostaglandin G/H synthase. \\nCOX is \\nantagonised by indomethacin which binds to the upper portion of the active  site, \\nand prevents the entry of its substrate (arachidonic acid) into the active site.\\n \\n \\nUnlike other NSAIDs, indomethacin also inhibits phospholipase A2\\n enzyme, \\nwhich catalyse the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids\\n. When \\ncompared to other NSAI Ds, indomethacin gives rise to  more adverse gastric \\neffects because of its specificity for COX -1 than COX -2. The protective gastric \\n', 'link': []}, 152: {'text': '152 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nmucosal layer is maintained using COX -1. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis is \\naccountable for the  analgesic, antipyretic and  anti-inflammatory effects of \\nindomethacin. However, i ncreased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, \\nand \\nsubsequent heat dissipation due to the action of indomethacin on hypothalamus \\nare responsible for its antipyretic effects.  \\n \\n5.1.6.2. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nIndomethacin is well-absorbed from GIT and reaches peak plasma concentration \\nwithin 2 hours. It has a \\nplasma half -life of about 3 hours . Nearly 90% of \\nindomethacin is bound \\nto plasma proteins, and its f\\nree and conjugated \\nmetabolites are excreted through urine, bile,\\n and faeces. \\nIndomethacin \\nmetabolites, including those which are formed by demethylation (50%) \\nconjugated w ith glucuronic acid (about 10%)\\n and deacylation, are mostly \\ninactive and about 10-20% is excreted unchanged in the urine. \\n \\n5.1.6.3. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nIndomethacin due to its better tolerable effects is used as a reserve drug in \\nsituations which require potent anti -inflammatory action and are not responding \\nto better tolerated NSAIDs, like ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, acute \\nexacerbations of destru ctive arthropathy, and acute gout.  Malignancy associated \\nfever which cannot be treated with other antipyretics \\nis also treated with \\nindomethacin. In  three 12 hourly doses of 0.1\\n-0.2mg/kg, indomethacin is the \\nmost common drug for medical closure of patent ductus arteriosus. Like other PG \\nsynthesis inhibitors, indomethacin has dramatic response on Bartter’s syndrome. \\n \\n5.1.6.4. \\nAdverse Effects \\nIndomethacin produces \\ndose-related toxic effects (35\\n-50%), and thus is \\ndiscontinued in 20% of patients. Abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, pancreatitis, \\nulceration, and anorexia are the GIT side effects. Nearly 20\\n-50% drug users \\nsuffer from  severe frontal headache and other CNS problems like  dizziness, \\nmental confusion, vertigo, psychosis, depression, and suicidal tendency. Patients \\nallergic to aspirin may \\nexperience hypersensitivity reactions\\n and serious \\nhaematological abnormalities.  Haematopoietic reactions include \\nneutropenia, \\nthrombocytopenia, and aplastic anaemia. Platelet function is reduced during the \\ndosing interval as with other NSAIDs. \\n \\nDue to high toxicity it is not prescribed for general use as an analgesic but is used \\nin special conditions such as acute gout, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis of \\nthe hip, pericarditis, pleurisy, and barter syndrome. Indomethacin has\\n been \\napproved by FDA for managing patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants.\\n \\nIndomethacin is prohibited in pregnant and nursing mothers and patients having \\npsychiatric disorders or peptic ulcer disease.     \\n \\n5.1.7. \\nPropionic Acid Derivatives - Ibuprofen \\nIbuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug originally marketed as Brufen. \\nIt is known to have an antiplatelet effect, though it is relatively mild and short-lived \\nwhen compared to that of aspirin or other better-known antiplatelet drugs.  \\n', 'link': []}, 153: {'text': 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Chapter 5)  \\n153 \\n*  \\n* \\n5.1.7.1. \\nMechanism of Action \\nIbuprofen’s exact mechanism of action is unidentified; but, since it is considered \\nan NSAID, it \\nnon-selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase enzyme involved in \\nprostaglandin (mediator of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulator of blood \\nclotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.   \\n \\nIbuprofen inhibits the activity of COX-1 and COX-2 as it is a non-selective COX \\ninhibitor. The synthesis of prostaglandins i nvolved in mediating inflamma tion, \\nfever, pain, and swelling  is reduced by the inhibition of COX-2 activity, while \\nCOX-1 inhibition give rise to  some of the side effects of ibuprofen such as GI \\nulceration. \\n \\n5.1.7.2. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nIbuprofen is well-absorbed on oral administration and is highly bound to plasma \\nproteins (90-99%). Displacement interactions are not significant clinically , i.e., \\ndose of oral anticoagulants and oral hypoglycaemics need not to be altered. \\nIbuprofen should not be used with anticoagulants as it inhibits platelet function. \\nLike other NSAIDs, it also decrease s diuretic and antihypertensive action of \\nfurosemide, thiazides, and \\uf062-blockers. \\n \\nIbuprofen enters the brain and synovial fluid, and can also cross placenta. It is \\nmostly metabolised in l iver by glucuronide conjugation and hydroxylation , and \\ngets excreted in bile and urine. \\n \\n5.1.7.3. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nThe main therapeutic uses of ibuprofen are: \\n1) Patent Ductus Arteriosus : In this neonatal condition, the ductus arteriosus \\n(i.e., the blood vessel connecting the main pulmonary artery to the proximal \\ndescending aorta) fails to close after birth  and poses a severe risk of heart \\nfailure. This situation can be treated with ibuprofen due to its  prostaglandin \\ninhibition activity and prostaglandin E2 keeps the ductus arteriosus open. \\n2) Rheumatoid Arthritis  and Osteoarthritis: It is frequently used for \\nsymptomatically treatin g musculoskeletal, inflammatory\\n and rheumatic \\ndisorders.  \\n3) Cystic Fibrosis: It is used in h\\nigh doses to decrease inflammation and \\npolymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs. \\n4) Orthostatic Hypotension: It is beneficial in this condition as it \\ncan \\nantagonise the effects of diuretics and induce sodium retention.  \\n5) Dental Pain: It is used for managing acute and chronic orofacial pain. \\n6) Minor Pain: It is used for reducing minor aches  and fever, and managing \\ndysmenorrhea. It is frequently used for relieving fever and tension \\nheadaches. \\n7) Investigational Uses: Efforts have been made for developing ibuprofen for \\nthe prophylaxis of Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer, and Parkinson disease. \\n', 'link': []}, 154: {'text': '154 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\n5.1.7.4. \\nAdverse Effects \\nIbuprofen and its congeners have better tolerability than aspirin.

Pyrrolo-Pyrrole Derivatives - Ketorolac \\nKetorolac has moderate anti-inflammatory action and potent analgesic activity. It \\nhas been considered to be used in post-operative analgesia as a sole agent as well \\nas for supplementing opioid analgesics. Ketorolac is extensively bound to plasma \\nproteins and has low clearance than opioid. It is metabolised by glucuronic acid \\nconjugation. In 30 -10mg doses, ketorolac produces similar effects as 100-50mg \\ndoses of pethidine and 12-6mg doses of morphine. Ketorolac may be given along \\nwith an opioid, in case of severe pain.  As a result, the dose of narcotic analgesic \\nis reduced and the relief from pain is high. \\n \\nKetorolac does not depress cardiovascular and respiratory systems; this is its major \\nadvantage.  It has a slight clinical importance even though it causes an increase in \\nbleeding time. On long-term administration, it has a less inclination for gastric \\nulceration (3% in doses of up  to 120mg/day). Like other NSAIDs, ketorolac can \\nalso cause renal impairment if the patient’s renal function dependa on renal PGs. \\nTopical (ophthalmic) ketorolac is permitted by FDA for treating\\n post-operative \\nocular inflammation after cataract extraction and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.   \\n \\n5.1.12. Preferential COX-2 Inhibitors - Nimesulide \\nComparatively, nimesulide is a COX-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \\ndrug having analgesic and antipyretic properties. It  is permitted to be used for \\ntreating acute pain, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis\\n, and primary \\ndysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults (more than 12 years of age).  \\n \\n5.1.12.1. Mechanism of Action \\nNimesulide acts by targeting the key mediators of the inflammatory process, like \\nCOX-2 mediated prostaglandins, proteolytic enzymes, histamine, and free radicals. \\n \\n5.1.12.2. Therapeutic Uses \\nNimesulide is used as an analgesic and antipyretic. It is also used in r heumatoid \\narthritis, osteoarthritis, other degenerative joint disorders,\\n musculoskeletal \\ndisorders, thrombophlebitis, and primary dysmenorrhea. \\n \\n5.1.12.3. Adverse Effects \\nThe common side effects of nimesulide are d\\niarrhoea, vomiting, skin rash, \\npruritis, dizziness, headache, and bitterness in mouth.

Selective COX-2 Inhibitors - Celecoxib \\nCelecoxib is a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug used for treating arthritis, \\nmenstrual cramps, pain, and colonic polyps. It is different from other NSAIDs \\nbecause it causes less inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and  intestine \\n(with short-term use) and does not interfere with blood clotting. \\n \\n5.1.13.1. Mechanism of Action \\nInflammation of arthritis causing pain, swelling, tenderness and fever is brought \\nabout by prostaglandins. Celecoxib blocks the cyclooxygenase -2 enzyme that \\nproduces prostaglandins, thus lowers the concentration of prostaglandins. As a result, \\ninflammation and the related fever, pain, tenderness, and swelling are reduced.  \\n \\n5.1.13.2. Therapeutic Uses \\nCelecoxib is used for relieving pain, fever, and swelling and tenderness resulting \\nfrom osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  \\n \\n5.1.13.3. Adverse Effects \\nThe common side effects of celecoxib are c ough and sneezing, fever, skin rash, \\nsore throat, pain in throat,  swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs,  back \\npain, gas, headache, heartburn, inability to sleep, and stuffy or runny nose. \\n \\n5.1.14. Para-Aminophenol Derivatives - Paracetamol \\nThe analgesic efficiency of paracetamol is same as asp irin, but its therapeutic \\ndoses have  weak anti -inflammatory effects. Paracetamol is effective ly used to \\nrelieve mild to moderate pain like headache or dysmenorrhea. It is also beneficial \\nin patients who need to avoid aspirin due to gastric intolerance, who have allergy \\nor bleeding tendency, or who are less than 12 years.  \\n \\n5.1.14.1. Mechanism of Action \\nParacetamol acts primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by \\ninhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX -1 and  COX-2), and COX -3 \\nenzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, paracetamol does \\nnot inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues, and thus, has no peripheral anti -\\ninflammatory affects. The antipyretic properties of paracetamol are due to direct \\neffects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral \\nvasodilation, sweating, and hence heat dissipation.  \\n \\n5.1.14.2. Pharmacokinetics \\nParacetamol gets rapidly and entirely absorbed from GIT , and reaches the p eak \\nplasma concentration in 30 -60 minutes. It has a plasma  half-life of 2 hours. It \\nvariably binds to plasma proteins (20-50%). It undergoes metabolism by hepatic \\nconjugation with sulphuric acid (about 35%), cysteine (about 3%), or glucuronic \\n acid (about 60%). It is primarily excreted through urine.  \\n5.1.14.3. Therapeutic Uses \\nParacetamol is used because of its antipyretic and analgesic properties and may \\nbe used as a replacement in patients who should not take aspirin , e.g., patients \\nhaving peptic ulcer or those in whom extension of bleeding time is undesirable.  \\n', 'link': []}, 158: {'text': '158 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nParacetamol is used to relief mild to moderate pain, fever, headache, migraine, \\ntoothache, menstrual cramps , pain associated with rheumatism, and symptoms \\nassociated with colds or influenza. \\n \\n5.1.14.4.

ANTI-GOUT DRUGS \\n \\n6.1.1. \\nIntroduction \\nGout is a hereditary metabolic disease characterised by overproduction of uric \\nacid. It is manifested clinically by intermittent attacks of acute arthritis due to \\ndeposition of urate crystals in synovial tissue of joints.  \\n \\nThe inflammatory response is characterised by local generation of inflammatory \\nmediators, including leukotrienes (LTs) and PGs, and migration of neutrophil \\ngranulocytes into the inflamed area.  \\n \\nThe accumulated neutrophils eng\\nulf the urate crystals by phagocytosis and \\ninduce the generation of toxic oxygen free radicals, which in turn cause \\nlysis of the cell with release of proteolytic enzymes that sustain the \\ninflammation.  \\n \\nUrates also stimulate the release of IL -1. Uric acid is synthesised from xanthine \\nby the action of xanthine oxidase enzyme and is excreted by the kidneys by \\nactive tubular secretion. \\n \\n6.1.2. \\nClassification \\nAnti-gout drugs can be classified as follows: \\n1) Based on their Mechanism of Action \\ni) \\nInhibit Uric Acid Synthesis: Allopurinol. \\nii) Increase Uric Acid Excretion: Probenecid and Sulphinpyrazone. \\niii) Inhibit Neutrophil Migration into Joint: Colchicine. \\niv) Inhibit Inflammation and Pain: NSAIDs. \\n2) Based on their Clinical Use \\ni) \\nDrugs Used in Acute Gout: Colchicine, NSAIDs, and Prednisolone.  \\nii) Drugs Used in Chronic Gout:\\n Allopurinol, Probenecid, and \\nSulphinpyrazone. \\n \\n6.1.3. \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe anti -gout action is not clear, but it is probably due to inhibition \\n \\nof neutrophil migration to urate deposited area, thereby decreasing \\nphagocytosis of \\nurates and inhibition of subseque\\nnt events inducing \\ninflammation ( figure 6.1). \\nCHAPTER \\n6 \\n \\n \\nAnti-Gout and \\nAntirheumatic Drugs \\n', 'link': []}, 162: {'text': '162 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n6.1.4. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nAnti-gout drugs are  used to treat  gout and certain types of  kidney stones. They \\nare \\nalso used to prevent increased uric acid levels in patients \\nreceiving cancer chemotherapy. These patients can have increased uric acid \\nlevels due to release of uric acid from the dying cancer  cells. The anti-gout drugs \\nreduce the amount of uric acid made by the body. \\n \\n6.1.5. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe adverse effects of anti-gout drugs include: \\n1) Fever, sore throat, and headache with a severe blistering, pe\\neling, and red \\nskin rash, \\n2) Pain or bleeding while urinating, \\n3) Nausea, upper stomach pain, itching, appetite loss, weight loss, dark urine, \\nclay-coloured stools, jaundice, \\n4) Urinating less than usual or not at all, \\n5) Joint pain, and flu symptoms, \\n6) Severe tingling, numbness, pain, and muscle weakness, and \\n7) Unusual bleeding from nose, mouth, vagina, or rectum. \\n \\n6.1.6. \\nIndividual Drugs \\nThe following commonly used anti-gout drugs are discussed below: \\n1) Probenecid, \\n2) Colchicine, \\n3) NSAIDs, \\n4) Allopurinol, and \\n5) Sulfinpyrazone. \\n \\n6.1.6.1. \\nProbenecid \\nProbenecid is a uricosuric drug that increases uric acid excretion in the urine.

It is \\nused for patients who are under -excretors of uric acid. As it has no apparent \\n analgesic or anti-inflammatory activity, it is not used for relief of acute gout. \\nMechanism of Action \\nSulfinpyrazone competitively inhibits uric acid reabsorption at the proximal \\nconvoluted tubule, thereby facilitating urinary excretion of uric acid and \\ndecreasing plasma urate concentrations. Sulfinpyrazone is not intended for the \\ntreatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic and \\n anti-inflammatory effects. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nSulfinpyrazone gets absorbed on oral administration. It is extensively  bound to \\nplasma proteins ( 98%) and displacement interactions may arise. It gets rapidly \\nexcreted, primarily through active secretion in proximal tubule. Uricosuric action \\n of a particular dose stays for 6-10 hours. \\nTherapeutic Uses \\nSulfinpyrazone is used in maintenance therapy in chronic gouty arthritis and \\ntophaceous gout. Its unlabelled uses include drug\\n-induced hyperuricemia, and \\n decreasing platelet aggregation. \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe adverse effects of sulfinpyrazone include u\\npper GI disturbances,  nausea, \\ndiarrhoea, blood loss, reactivation or aggravation of peptic ulcer,  precipitation of \\nacute gout attacks, rashes (less frequently), jaundice, blood dyscrasias ( anaemia, \\nagranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia ), and  bronchoconstriction in patients with \\naspirin-induced asthma. \\n \\n6.2. ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGS \\n \\n6.2.1. \\nIntroduction \\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a type of autoimmune disease, characterised by the \\ninflammation in joints, synovial proliferation, and destruction of articular cartilage. \\nThe first line drugs used in the treatment of RA are NSAIDs that help in relieving \\npain, swelling, morning stiffness, immobility, but do not show complete cure.\\n \\n \\nAnti-rheumatic drugs  are specific anti -inflammatory or analgesics, used to \\nsuppress the rheumatoid process and also bring the remission. These drugs do not \\ninclude corticosteroids. They can be used along with the NSAIDs and are also \\ncalled as Disease Modifying Anti -Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)  or Slow \\n Acting Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (SAARDs).  \\nThe complete action of the DMARDs is achieved in few months of regular \\ntreatment and the complete relapse is achieved after a few months of the therapy. \\nThe recent development in this thera\\npy is the addition of a few \\nBiological \\nResponse Modifiers (BRMs) in case of resistance. \\n', 'link': []}, 166: {'text': '166 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\n6.2.2. \\nClassification \\nThe anti-rheumatic drugs are classified as follows: \\n1) Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) \\ni) Immunosuppressants – Methotrexate, Azathioprine, and Cyclosporine. \\nii) Sulfasalazine. \\niii) Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine. \\niv) Leflunomide. \\nv) Gold sodium thiomalate and Auranofin. \\nvi) D-Penicillamine. \\n2) Biologic Response Modifiers (BRMs) \\ni) TNF\\uf061 Inhibitors: Etanercept, Infliximab, and Adalimumab. \\nii) IL-1 Antagonist: Anakinra. \\n3) Adjuvant Drugs: Corticosteroids – Prednisolone. \\n \\n6.2.3. \\nDisease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) \\nThe DMARDs have the capability of reducing the joint pain in patients of \\nrheumatoid arthritis. Gold salts, glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, \\nand many other newer immunologic drugs (\\nlike leflunomide, etanercept, and \\ninfliximab) are the common examples of DMARDs. These drugs have a very slow \\n onset of action and anti-rheumatic effects develop in several weeks to months.  \\nThe mechanism of action of DMARDs is that they subdue the proliferation and \\nactivation of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, thereby reducing their \\nability of causing joint inflammation and destruction. As joint erosion is observed in \\n2 years of RA, the early use of DMARDs is suggested by many rheumatologists; but \\nthe toxicity and the loss of efficacy of DMARDs with time, limits the therapy. In few \\ncases, the patients should stop taking DMARDs within 5 years.\\n \\n \\n6.2.3.1. \\nMethotrexate (MTX) \\nMethotrexate is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, and has immunosuppressant \\nand anti -inflammatory action. It is beneficial in RA as it inhibits \\ncytokine \\nproduction, chemotaxis, and cell-mediated immune reaction. Low doses of MTX \\n(7.5-15mg taken weekly via oral route) shows improved acceptability in RA. It has \\na rapid onset of action (4-6 weeks), thus is the drug of choice for initial treatment. \\nMTX is considered the standard treatment for most patients, including juvenile RA. \\n \\n \\nMTX given orally has variable bioavailability, which is affected by the presence \\nof food in stomach. In patients having renal disease, its excretion is delayed (and \\n thus should be avoided in such patients).  \\nMTX levels and toxicity is increased by probenec id and aspirin. Trimethoprim \\n inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and causes bone marrow depression. \\nNodulosis, oral ulceration, and GI upset are the major side effects of low dose \\nMTX regimen; while its prolonged therapy causes dose\\n-dependent progressive \\nliver damage which further leads to cirrhosis in some patients. Chest infection \\noccurs more commonly. MTX should be avoided in pregnancy, breast -feeding, \\nliver disease, active infection, leukopenia, and peptic ulcer. \\n', 'link': []}, 167: {'text': 'Anti-Gout and Antirheumatic Drugs (Chapter 6)  \\n167 \\n*  \\n* \\n6.2.3.2. \\nAzathioprine \\nAzathioprine is a purine an timetabolite which converts into 6 -mercaptopurine \\nunder the influence of Thiopurine Methyl Transferase (TPMT) enzyme; and this \\nconverted form produces the relevant action. It suppresses cell\\n-mediated \\nimmunity, inflammation, and also selectively affects the\\n differentiation and \\nfunction of T -cells and natural killer cells. Azathioprine in combination with \\ncorticosteroids produces a steroid sparing effect; and due to this effect it is used \\nwidely in cases with systemic manifestations.  \\n \\n6.2.3.3. \\nSulfasalazine  \\nThe structure of sulfasalazine consists of sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid. \\nThe compound is used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and has anti\\n-\\n inflammatory property. It can also be used in the treatment of RA. \\nIts mechanism of action is unknown; how ever the expected mechanism of action \\nis that sulfasalazine in colon breaks into its 2 parts by bacterial action, of which \\nsulfapyridine is systemically absorbed and is expected to be the active moiety. \\nThe drug is moderately effective in the treatment of RA, and its side effects are \\n comparatively low.  \\nThe common side effect is neutropenia or thrombocytopenia observed in 10% of \\nthe patients under this therapy. Hepatitis may also occur in some patients. The \\ndrug is used as the second line treatment and it is usually used in mild cases. \\n \\n6.2.3.4. \\nChloroquine \\nChloroquine is basically an antimalarial drug, which can also be used in the \\ntreatment of RA. In the complete population of the people taking chloroquine, \\nhalf of the population respond positively to this drug. It proves to be beneficial in \\ntreating morning stiffness and joint pain of RA. It also reduces the skin lesions of \\n lupus erythematosus. \\nThe mechanism of action of chloroquine is not completely known. It is expected \\nto exert its partial effect by inhibiting  the production of inflammatory mediators, \\nand also by inte\\nrfering with the actions of leuk\\nocytes. The lymphocyte \\nproliferation is also inhibited by chloroquine.  The main organ affected by long \\nusage of chloroquine is eye, as the drug may cause corneal op\\nacities and can \\neven cause serious retinal damage. \\n \\n6.2.3.5. \\nLeflunomide \\nLeflunomide is an immunomodulator which inhibits lymphocyte proliferation in \\npatients having active RA. It suppresses the arthritic symptoms and also retards \\nthe radiological progression of disease. Its efficacy is comparable to that of MTX \\n and onset of action is also fast (4 weeks). \\nLeflunomide within the body gets rapidly converted into its active metabolite \\n(half-life of 2 weeks), which inhibits dihydro\\n-orotate dehydrogenase and \\npyrimidine synthesis in actively dividing cells. It may also depress the antibody \\nproduction by B-cells. Leflunomide is given in a loading dose of 100mg daily for \\n3 days followed by 20mg OD. \\n', 'link': []}, 168: {'text': '168 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\nLeflunomide causes diarrhoea, headache, nausea, rashes, hair loss, \\nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia, increased risk of chest infection, and raised \\nhepatic transaminases. Its use should be avoided in children and in pregnant and \\nlactating women. It is an alternative to \\nMTX, but in combination causes \\nhepatotoxicity.  \\n \\n6.2.3.6. \\nGold Salts \\nSodium aurothiomalate and auranofin are the two commonly used gold salts. \\nGold salts have been completely substituted with other DMARDs (methotrexate \\nspecifically). However, the gold salts are still being prescribed. The prescribers and \\ndispensers should know about the existence, uses, and adverse effects of gold salts. \\nTheir onset of action is slow, and produces maximum response after 3-4 months of \\nthe therapy. They act by reducing the swelling of joints and also relieve the pain \\n and stiffness. Gold salts delay the progression of joint and bone damage.  \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe mechanism of action of gold salts is not known. The expected mechanism is \\nthat they inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, the release of chemical mediators of \\n inflammation, and also reduce the migration of leukocytes in tissues. \\nTherapeutic Use \\nSodium aurothiomalate is used in active progressive RA and in progressive \\njuvenile chronic arthritis. Auranofin is also used in active progressive RA when \\n the effect produced by the NSAIDs alone is insufficient.  \\nAdverse Effects \\nAbout 1/3rd of the patients taking gold salts, develop these serious adverse \\neffects, which may also require the withdrawal of therapy: \\n1) Itching and rashes on skin which progresses to exfoliation; thus the treatment \\nis stopped, \\n2) Renal damage, \\n3) Bone marrow suppression, thus blood counts should be checked weekly, and \\nthe patient should inform the doctor in case of bleeding, bruising or sore throat,\\n \\n4) Stomatitis, and \\n5) Dose-related diarrhoea caused by auranofin; this is controlled by taking high \\nfibre diet.  \\n \\n6.2.3.7. \\nPenicillamine \\nPenicillamine has better effects when compared to other RA drugs, but the effect \\nproduced by methotrexate is much wide and expressive. Chemically\\n, \\npenicillamine is a modified form of cysteine (amino acid), which interfere s with \\n the action of enzymes attacking the joint proteins; thus suppresses inflammation.   \\nMechanism of Action \\nThe mechanism of action of penicillamine (a good chelating agent) in RA is \\nindefinite. It acts by inhibiting the synthesis and release of IL -1, and synthesis of \\nDNA and mucopolysaccharide. It also prevents the maturation of newly \\nsynthesised collagen. \\n', 'link': []}, 169: {'text': 'Anti-Gout and Antirheumatic Drugs (Chapter 6)  \\n169 \\n*  \\n* \\nTherapeutic Use \\nPenicillamine is not only used in RA, but also in Wilson’s disease and in chronic \\nlead poisoning and cysti nuria (high concentration s of cysteine amino acid in \\nurine). \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nThe adverse effects produced by penicillamine include anorexia, nausea, \\nvomiting, impaired taste, and buccal ulcers. The serious adverse \\neffects are  \\nthrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, renal damage, myosi\\ntis, systemic lupus \\nerythematosus, skin rashes, and autoimmune disease. \\n \\n6.2.4. \\nBiologic DMARDs \\nAdalimumab (Humira), Anakinra (Kineret), Etanercept (Enbrel), Infliximab \\n(Remicade), and Rituximab (MabThera) are the co\\nmmonly used biologic \\nDMARDs. These are monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF-\\uf061. \\n \\nIntravenous infusions of infliximab are given every 6 -8 weeks under hospital \\nsupervision. It is prescribed in combination with methotrexate, which suppresses \\nthe body’s i\\nmmune response to infliximab. Subcutaneous injection of \\nadalimumab is given once or twice weekly. Infliximab is associated with a \\nworsening of demyelinating disease. \\n \\nEtanercept is a fusion protein p75 TNF-\\uf061 receptor immunoglobulin which binds \\nto circulati ng TNF -\\uf061 and inactivates it. It is associated with bone marrow \\nsuppression. Anakinra is a recombinant IL -R\\uf061-receptor antagonist which the \\npatients take daily \\non their own by subcutaneous route. It is prescribed in \\ncombination with methotrexate. \\n \\nA newer cl ass of biologic DMARD is \\nselective co -stimulation modulators . \\nAbatacept is the first drug of this class, which selectively modulates the CD80 or \\nCD86-28 co -stimulatory signal required for full T\\n-cell modulation. These \\npreparations suppress the immune respo nse, and the treatment is discontinued in \\npatients with increased risk of sepsis or with diabetes.  \\n \\n6.2.5. \\nCorticosteroids \\nCorticosteroids have potent immunosuppressant and anti -inflammatory activity. \\nThey can be inducted at any stage in RA in combination with first or second line \\ndrugs, if potent anti-inflammatory action is required while continuing the NSAID \\nalong with  DMARD. They produce a quick symptomatic relief, but do not \\ncompletely halt the progression of RA;\\n however they slow down the joint \\ndestruction and bony erosions.  \\n \\nCorticosteroids used for long -term have some serious disadvantages; therefore, \\neither low doses (5 -10mg prednisolone or equivalent) are used to supplement \\nNSAIDs or high doses for short per\\niods are recommended in severe systemic \\nmanifestations (organ -threatening disease, vasculitis) while the patient awaits \\nresponse from a remission inducing drug. \\n', 'link': []}, 170: {'text': '170 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\n6.3.

PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS ACTING \\nON ENDOCRINE SYSTEM \\n \\n7.1.1. \\nIntroduction and Basic Concepts i\\nn Endocrine \\nPharmacology \\nAll multicellular creatures require coordinating systems for regulating and \\nintegrating the function of differentiating cells. In higher ani mals, this function \\nis performed by the nervous and endocrine system s. The endocrine system acts \\nby releasing chemical agents (usually in the blood) and \\nis important for the \\nproper development and functioning of organisms\\n. The integration of \\ndevelopmental events like cellular proliferation, growth and differentiation, and \\nalso the management of respiration, movement, sensory perception, \\nreproduction, metabolism, and excretion  depend on “chemical cues”. These \\nchemical cues are \\nsynthesised and secreted by spe\\ncial cells present in the \\nanimal-endocrine cells. \\n \\nHormones control the following major physiologic processes:  \\n1) Growth and maturation,  \\n2) Intermediary metabolism, and  \\n3) Reproduction.  \\n \\nEndocrinology is a branch of a broader field of internal medicine,\\n and is the \\nstudy of disorders of endocrinal glands. \\nThe basics of endocrinology have \\nevolved from the studies of hormone action. Many characteristics of \\ntranscriptional regulation and concepts of intracellular signalling and receptors \\nare vital components of this\\n field. Endocrinology is eventually the study of \\nintercellular communication. \\n \\nTypically, hormones mediate the communication between \\nthe organs, as \\ndemonstrated by the effect of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) on kidney or bone. \\nSometimes, communication happens within the same tissue, as demonstrated by \\nautocrine (acting on the same cell) and paracrine (acting on the neighbouring \\ncells) actions of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1).  \\n \\nThe endocrine system  comprises of glands which secrete a type of \\nhormone \\nfor regulating the body  functions. The endocrine system is an informal signal \\nsystem similar to the nervous system. Various functions of an organism like \\ngrowth, development, metabolism, tissue function, and mood are regulated by \\nhormones.   \\nCHAPTER \\n7 \\n \\nPharmacology of Drugs Acting \\non Endocrine System - I \\n', 'link': []}, 173: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n173 \\n*  \\n* \\n7.1.2. \\nHormones \\nThe word hormone has originated from a Greek word hormaein which means to \\nimpel. Thus, hormone is a substance which is secreted by specialised cells and \\ntransported to a distant site to exert its action upon specific tissues. Hormones are \\nsynthesised and discharged by endocrine glands directly into the blood circulation \\nwithout the intervention of ducts, therefore are also known as ductless glands. \\n \\nIf a hormone acts on other endocrine gland or tissue, it just stimulates or inhibits \\nits function. \\n \\n7.1.3. \\nClassification \\nHormones secreted by the endocrine or ductless glands are classified as follows: \\n1) Pituitary \\ni) Anterior Pituitary \\na) Growth Hormone (GH, Somatotrophin), \\nb) Prolactin (Prl), \\nc) Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH, Corticotropin), \\nd) Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH, Thyrotropin), and \\ne) Gonadotropins – Follicle Stimulating Hor\\nmone (FSH) and \\nLuteinizing Hormone (LH) \\nii) Posterior Pituitary \\na) Oxytocin, and \\nb) Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH, Vasopressin) \\n2) Thyroid: Thyroxine (T4), Triiodothyronine (T3), and Calcitonin \\n3) Parathyroid: Parathormone (PTH) \\n4) Pancreas: Insulin and Glucagon \\n5) Adrenals \\ni) Cortex \\na) Glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone), \\nb) Mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), and \\nc) Sex steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone). \\nii) Medulla: Adrenaline and Noradrenaline \\n6) Gonads \\ni) Androgens (testosterone), \\nii) Estrogens (estradiol), and \\niii) Progestins (progesterone). \\n \\n7.2. ANTERIOR PITUITARY HORMONES \\n \\n7.2.1. \\nIntroduction \\nPituitary is an essential glan d of the body and  is generally called as the master \\ngland. It is attached to the base of the brain by a thin stalk and sits in a bony \\nhollow pituitary fossa, which is located behind the bridge of nose, below the \\nbase of brain, and close to the optic nerves. Pituitary gland produces hormones \\nwhich control many functions of other endocrine glands, thus it is considered the \\nmost important part of the endocrine system.  \\n', 'link': []}, 174: {'text': '174 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nPituitary gland is divided into the following three sections: \\n1) Anterior Lobe (Adenohypophysis):  This lobe has two portions,  i.e., the \\npars distalis (or the anterior pituitary itself) and the pars tuberalis, which \\nforms the pituit ary stalk by wrapping around the infundibular stem. The \\nanterior lobe is involved in sexual maturation, re\\nproduction, and \\ndevelopment of body. The hormones produced by the anterior lobe  regulate \\ngrowth and stimulate t he adrenal and thyroid gland s, besides ovaries and \\ntestes. Prolactin, which allows new mothers to produce milk, is also \\nproduced by the anterior lobe. \\n2) Intermediate Lobe:  This lobe produces a hormone \\nwhich stimulates the \\nmelanocytes, which are the \\ncells that \\nproduce melanin to \\ncontrol \\npigmentation (skin colour). \\n3) Posterior Lobe (Neurohypophysis):  This lobe has three sections, i.e., the \\nmedian eminence (a neural tissue of hypothalamus from which the pituitary \\nprotrudes), the posterior pituitary itself, and the infundibular stem (which \\nconnects both ). The posterior lobe produces antidiuretic hormone \\nwhich \\nretrieves water from the kidneys and preserves it in the bloodstream for \\npreventing dehydration. Oxytocin, which assists in uterine contractions \\nduring childbirth and also stimulates the production and release of milk, is \\nalso produced by the posterior lobe. \\n \\nHormones Secreted by Pituitary Gland  \\nCollectively, the lobes of pituitary gland secrete various hormones, which affect \\nmany functions of the body. For example, the anterior pituitary produces five \\nprotein and polypeptide hormones (table 7.1). \\n \\nTable 7.1: Hormones Secreted by the Pituitary Gland \\nHormones  \\nFunctions \\n1) Anterior Pituitary  \\n \\ni) \\nGrowth Hormone (GH) \\nStimulates cell growth;  primary targets are \\nmuscle and bone, where GH stimulates \\namino acid uptake and protein synthesis; also \\nstimulates fat breakdown in the body. \\nii) Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone \\n(TSH) \\nStimulates release of thyroxine and tri\\n-\\niodothyronine. \\niii) Adrenocorticotropic Hormone \\n(ACTH) \\nStimulates secretion of hormones by the \\nadrenal cortex, especially glucocorticoids. \\niv) Gonadotropins (FSH and LH) \\nStimulates gamete production and hormone \\nproduction by the gonads. \\nv) Prolactin \\nStimulates milk production by the breast. \\n2) Intermediate Lobe  \\n \\nMelanocyte-Stimulating Hormone \\nMSH) \\nFunction in humans is unknown. \\n3) Posterior Pituitary \\n \\ni) \\nAntidiuretic Hormone (ADH) \\nStimulates water re -absorption by nephrons \\nof the kidney. \\nii) Oxytocin \\nStimulates ejection of milk from breasts and \\nuterine contractions during birth. \\n', 'link': []}, 175: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n175 \\n*  \\n* \\n7.2.2. \\nGrowth Hormone (Somatotropin) \\nGrowth Hormone (GH) is a \\nprotein-based, 191-amino acid , single-chain \\npolypeptide hormone , which stimulates growth and cell reproduction and \\nregeneration in humans and other animals . It is synthesised, stored, and secreted \\n by the somatotroph cells present in the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary. \\nThe growth hormone  produced natively and naturally in animals \\nis termed \\nsomatotropin, whereas, the growth hormone\\n produced by recombinant DNA \\ntechnology is termed somatropin (abbreviated as rhGH in humans). \\n \\n7.2.2.1. \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nThe production of GH is modulated by exercise, nutrition, stress, sleep, and the \\nhormone itself. But, two hypothalamus hormones and one hormone from the \\nstomach are its major regulators: \\n1) Growth Hormone -Releasing Hormone (GHRH):\\n It is hypothalamic \\npeptide which stimulates the synthesis and secretion of growth hormone.  \\n2) Somatostatin (SS):  It is a  peptide \\nproduced by \\nmany body  tissues, \\nincluding hypothalamus. In response \\nto GHRH  and othe r stimulatory \\nfactors (like low blood glucose \\nconcentration), somatostatin inhibits \\nthe release of GH.  \\n3) Ghrelin: It is a peptide hormone \\nsecreted from the stomach. It binds to \\nthe receptors on somatotrophs and \\nstimulates GH secretion. \\n \\nSecretion of GH is a part of a negative feedback loop that involves IGF-1. High \\nlevels of IGF-1 in blood decrease GH secretion by suppressing the somatotroph \\n directly and by stimulating the release of somatostatin from hypothalamus. \\nGH also feeds back for inhibiting \\nthe secretion of GHRH, and has a direct \\n (autocrine) inhibitory effect on the secretions from the somatotroph.  \\nA pulsatile pattern of release is formed when all the factors affecting \\nthe \\nsynthesis and secretion of GH are integrated. The basal concentrations of GH are \\nvery low in blood. In children and young adults, the period of GH release is just \\n after the onset of deep sleep. \\nThe major regulators of  GH secretion by somatotrophs are the peptides released \\nby neurosecretory nuclei of hypothalamus (GHRH and somatostatin) in the portal \\n venous blood surrounding the pituitary.  \\nThough the balance of these stimulating and inhibiting peptides \\nregulate the \\nrelease of GH, still the balance is affected by various inhibitors of GH secretion \\n(e.g., free fatty acids) a nd physiological stimulators ( e.g., nutrition, sleep, and \\nexercise).   \\nHypothalamus \\nGHRH \\nSS \\n–  \\n+  \\n– \\n+ \\nPituitary \\nGrowth \\nHormone \\nLiver, etc. \\nIGF-1 \\n+  \\n–  \\n+ \\n–  \\nGhrelin from \\nstomach \\nFigure 7.1: Regulation of Growth \\nHormone Secretion \\n', 'link': []}, 176: {'text': '176 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\n7.2.2.2. \\nPhysiological Actions \\nGrowth hormone has the following physiological actions: \\n1) It controls balanced growth. \\n2) It stimulates the production of hepatic somatomedins having anabolic activity. \\n3) It stimulates protein synthesis in skeletal muscles and regulates the growth of \\nbones. \\n4) It increases insulin secretion in hyperglycaemic conditions.  \\n5) It induces lipolysis. \\n6) It‟s some effects are similar to that of prolactin. \\n \\n7.2.2.3. \\nGrowth Hormone Analogues \\nGiven below are the analogues of growth hormone: \\n1) Peptide Hormones  \\ni) Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH ) binding to the Growth \\nHormone Releasing Hormone Receptor (GHRHR). \\nii) Ghrelin binding to the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptors (GHSR).  \\n2) Sex Hormones \\ni) Androgen is secreted excessively  from testis in males and from adrenal \\ncortex in females during puberty. \\nii) Oestrogen. \\n3) Clonidine and L-DOPA by stimulating GHRH release, \\n4) Hypoglycaemia, arginine and propranolol by inhibiting somatostatin release, \\n5) Deep sleep, \\n6) Fasting, and \\n7) Vigorous exercise. \\n \\n7.2.2.4. \\nGrowth Hormone Inhibitors \\nGrowth hormone secretion is inhibited by the following: \\n1) Somatostatin: It is a 14 amino acid peptide that can inhibit the secretion of \\nGH, TSH, and prolactin from pituitary gland. It also inhibits the secretion of \\ninsulin and glucagon form pancreas, and gastrointestinal secretions (such as \\ngastrin and HCl ). As a side effect\\n, the GI action produces diarrhoea, \\nsteatorrhea, dyspepsia, nause a, and hypochlorhydria. Somatostatin \\ncauses \\nconstriction of hepatic, splanchnic, and renal blood vessels. The reduced GI \\nmucosal blood can be used for controlling bleeding oesophageal varices and \\nbleeding peptic ulcer; however, nowadays octreotide is prefe rred as it has a \\nlonger duration of action, it has an adjuvant value in diabetic ketoacidosis (by \\ninhibiting glucagon and GH secretion)\\n, it can be used for reducing \\ncomplications after pancreatic surgery, and it is helpful in pancreatic, biliary \\nor intestinal fistulae due to its anti-secretory action.    \\n \\nSomatostatin is limitedly used in acromegaly due to its short duration of \\naction ( half-life is  2-3 minutes) and lack of selectivity to only inhibit GH \\nsecretion and GH rebound on discontinuation.  \\n', 'link': []}, 177: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n177 \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Octreotide: It is a synthetic octapeptide analogue of somatostatin.  It more \\neffectively inhibits growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin; however, it \\nmimics the pharmacological actions of natural somatostatin.   \\n \\nPharmacokinetics: The half -life of octreotide is nearly 90 minutes ( much \\nlonger than that of \\nsomatostatin). It is administered parenterally \\n(subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously) as it is poorly absorbed \\nfrom the gut. \\n \\n \\nUses: Octreotide is used for the symptomatic treatment of\\n carcinoid \\nsyndrome, acute variceal bleeding,  acromegaly, and p olycystic diseases of \\nliver and kidney. \\n \\nAdverse Effects:  The adverse effects \\nof octreotide include nausea, gall \\nstones (due to biliary stasis) abdominal pain, and steatorrhoea.  \\n \\n7.2.2.5. \\nGrowth Hormone Abnormalities \\nLack of growth hormone or \\ndefects in its binding with receptors \\nis called as \\ngrowth retardation  or dwarfism. The effects of GH deficiency depend\\n on \\nthe age of onset of disorder and can occur due to heritable or acquired\\n \\ndisease.  \\n \\nThe effects of excessive secretion of GH  also depend on the age of onset and \\nmay give rise to the following two disorders:  \\n1) Gigantism: It occurs due to excessive GH secretion in young children. It \\noccurs occasionally due to a tumour of somatotropes. \\n2) Acromegaly: It occurs due to excessive GH secretion  in adults, generally \\ndue to benign pituitary tumours. The symptoms of acromegaly include soft -\\ntissue swelling, overgrowth of extremities, abnormalities in jaw structure, \\nand cardiac diseases.  \\n \\nTreatment: The symptoms of GH abnormalities  can be improved by surgery, \\nirradiation, and by using L-dopa and bromocriptine that suppress GH secretion \\n(stimulate GH secretion in normal subjects). \\nA synthetic analogue of \\nsomatostatin, octreotide, is effective in\\n acromegaly and Zollinger\\n-Ellison \\nSyndrome. \\n \\n7.2.3. \\nProlactin (Prl) \\nProlactin is a peptide hormone which is secreted by the anterior pituitary and is \\nstructurally similar to GH. Dopamine inhibits its secretion. \\n \\nProlactin enters a cell and activ\\nates a tyrosine kinase for promoting tyrosine \\nphosphorylation and gene activation. \\n \\n7.2.3.1. \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nHypothalamus performs tonic inhibitory control of prolactin secretion\\n  \\n(figure 7.2) with dopamine (actin g on D 2 receptors on the lactotrophs) as the \\ninhibitor . \\n', 'link': []}, 178: {'text': '178 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nSuckling is the primary stimul\\nus for the \\nrelease of prolactin.

After childbirth, however prolactin exerts \\nunobstructed action as oestrogen and progesterone concentration declines. \\n4) Prolactin causes  natural contraception by inhibiting o\\nvulation through its \\nanti-gonadotropin effect.  \\n5) It stimulates RNA synthesis to produce milk proteins and promote lactose \\ngenesis.  \\n \\n7.2.3.3. \\nProlactin Inhibitors - Bromocriptine \\nBromocriptine is a synthetic ergot derivative  and a potent dopamine agonist. It \\nacts as a part ial agonist or antagonist of D 1 receptor at certain dopamine sites in \\nthe brain, whereas it has a greater action on D2 receptors. It is not an oxytocic but \\n a weak \\uf061-adrenergic blocker. \\nActions \\n1) It is a strong anti -galactopoietic as it decreases prolactin release by the \\nactivation of dopaminergic receptors present on lactotroph cells. \\n2) It increases GH release in normal \\nindividuals, however, reduces the same \\nfrom pituitary tumours that cause acromegaly. \\n3) It exerts levodopa-like anti-parkinsonian and behavioural actions in CNS. \\n4) It stimulates dopaminergic receptors in the CTZ and produces nausea and \\nvomiting. \\n5) It centrally suppresses postural reflexes and weak peripheral \\n\\uf061-adrenergic \\nblockade and causes hypotension.  \\n6) It decreases gastrointestinal motility. \\nFigure 7.2: Regulation of Prolactin \\nSecretion and the Drugs that Modify it. \\n(TRH, Thyrotrophin-Releasing Hormone; \\nPRF, Prolactin-Releasing Factor; PRIF, \\nProlactin Release-Inhibiting Factor) \\nBromocriptine \\nDopamine \\nAntagonists \\nAnterior \\nPituitary \\nPRF \\nTRH \\nPRIF \\n(Dopamine) \\nProlactin \\nMammary glands \\nHypothalamus \\nSuckling \\nreflex \\n + \\n + \\n – \\n + \\n + \\n – \\n', 'link': []}, 179: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n179 \\n*  \\n* \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nOnly 1/3 rd of bromocriptine gets absorbed on oral administration. It undergoes \\nhigh first pass metabolism in liver, thus has reduced  bioavailability. Its plasma \\n half-life is 3-6 hours and its metabolites are excreted through bile.  \\nUses  \\n1) Hyperprolactinemia:  Low doses of b romocriptine and cabergoline (2.5-\\n10mg/day for bromocriptine or 0.25 -1.0mg for cabergoline twice weekly) \\nare the first line drugs \\nfor microprolactinomas causing galactorrhoea, \\ninfertility, a nd amenorrhoea in women; and gynaecomastia, sterility, \\nand \\nimpotence in men. In a few weeks, the individual starts \\nresponding and \\nserum prolactin level s become normal. Bromocriptine intake \\nshould be \\nstopped if a woman conceives , so that no teratogenic effe cts occur. 60-75% \\ntumours show relapse during therapy. An individual responds till the drug \\nis given  and relapses occur on stopping it;\\n so, life -long maintenance \\ntherapy is required.   \\n2) Acromegaly: Relatively high doses of bromocriptine are necessary (5\\n-\\n20mg/day) \\nin acromegaly. However, it is \\nless efficient than \\noctreotide/somatostatin. Its advantages include low costs and oral administration.\\n \\n3) Parkinsonism: High doses of b\\nromocriptine (20-80mg/day) produce \\nnoticeable side effects, and the\\n response resembles t o that of levodopa . \\nNow it is prescribed as an adjunct to levodopa in low doses to patients who \\nare not effectively benefitted or to those who show noticeable „on\\n-off‟ \\neffect. \\n4) Hepatic coma: Bromocriptine may cause arousal. \\n5) In case of neonatal death, bromoc\\nriptine suppresses lactation and breast \\nenlargement, but it is not prescribed because of poor risk:benefit ratio. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\n1) Early: Constipation, nasal blockage, nausea, and vomiting\\n are early side \\neffects. Postural hypotension is noticeable at the beginning of therapy and \\nsyncope occur s if the initial dose is high.

Thus, it is \\nalso called as FSH/LH-RH or LHRH or gonadorelin. It has been suggested that \\nthe amplitude and frequency of GnRH pulses decides the amount of LH or FSH \\nor both that will be secreted. This is becau se GnRH is secreted in pulses and the \\namplitude and frequency of pulses changes during follicular (high frequency, low \\namplitude) and luteal (low frequency, high amplitude) phases. \\n \\nThe feedback regulation of FSH and LH may also differ. Generally, the feedback \\ninhibition of LH is more noticeable than \\nthat of FSH. In females, secretion of \\nFSH and LH from hypothalamus is inhibited by estradiol and progesterone, and \\nalso by direct action on pituitary. But, the \\nLH and FSH secretion is also \\nstimulated by the pre-ovulatory rise in estrogen level . There are other regulatory \\nsubstances also, such as inhibin (a peptide from ovaries and testes that inhibits \\nFSH release ) and dopamine (that inhibits LH release\\n). GnRH acts on \\ngonadotropes through a G\\n-protein coupled rece\\nptor acting by increasing \\nintracellular Ca2+ by PIP2 hydrolysis.  \\n \\nAt puberty, gonadotropin secretion elevates and is higher in women than in men. \\nThe levels of LH and FSH remains almost constant (LH>FSH) in men, while \\nthey fluctuate in menstruating women.  In the follicular phase, low levels of LH \\nand moderate levels of FSH  are seen . Just before ovulation, the levels of LH \\nincreases, followed by a gradual fall in the luteal phase. Due to loss of feedback \\ninhibition by sex steroids and inhibin, \\nthe levels of gonadotropins are high in \\nmenopausal women. \\n \\n7.2.5.2. \\nPhysiological Actions \\nThe physiological functions of gonadotropins are:  \\n1) FSH: It induces oogenesis and secretion of oestrogen in females by \\nstimulation of graafian follicles . It stimulates spermatogenesis in ma les. In \\nits, atrophy of ovaries and testes occur. \\n2) LH: It induces  complete development of follicles to secretory stage and \\nsecretion of oestrogen.

Some other uses of FSH and LH are:  \\n1) To induce ovulation, \\n2) Cryptorchism, and \\n3) Diagnosis of diseases of male and female reproductive system. \\n \\n7.2.5.4. \\nGonadotropin Analogues \\nGiven below are the analogues of gonadotropins: \\n1) Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (Gn\\nRH): Intravenous injection of \\ngonadorelin synthetic GnRH (100\\uf06dg) induces a quick release of LH and FSH \\nand increased gonadal steroid levels. Due to fast enzymatic degradation, it \\nhas short plasma half-life (4-8 minutes). It is also used for testing pituitary -\\ngonadal axis in males and hypogonadism in females.   \\n2) Superactive/Long-Acting GnRH Agonists: Many analogues of GnRH have \\nbeen developed, e.g., Buserelin, Goserelin, Leuprolide, Nafarelin, Triptorelin. \\nThese are 15-150 times more potent than natural GnRH and act longer (\\nhalf-life is \\n2-6 hours) due to resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis and high affinity for GnRH. \\n \\nNasal sprays or  subcutaneous injections of superactive GnRH agonists  are \\nused. As a result, a reversible pharmacological oophorectomy/orchiectomy is \\nproduced which is used in prostatic carcinoma, endomet\\nriosis, \\npremenopausal breast cancer, precocious puberty, polycystic ovarian disease, \\nuterine leiomyoma, and to support induced ovulation. It can also be used as a \\ncontraceptive in both males and females.  \\n3) Nafarelin: It is a long-acting GnRH agonist and is 150 times more effective \\nthan the natural GnRH. Within 10 days, down regulation of pituitary GnRH \\noccurs and peak inhibition of gonadotropin release is achieved in a month. Its \\nplasma half-life is 2 -3 hours. It is broken down to smaller peptide segments \\nin the body. It is used in the following conditions:  \\ni) Assisted Reproduction: \\nIncreased endogenous LH needs to be \\nsuppressed when ovarian hyperstimulation is tried by using exogenous \\nFSH and LH injection, for producing precisely timed mature oocytes.\\n \\nThis is achieved by taking 400 \\uf06dg BD intranasal nafarelin, and reducing \\nthe dose to 200\\uf06dg BD during menstruation.  \\nii) Uterine Fibroids: Nafarelin in 200\\uf06dg BD intranasal dose for 3-6 months \\nis used for reducing leiomyoma size and providing symptomatic relief.  \\niii) Endometriosis: Nafarelin in 200\\uf06dg dose in alternate nostril BD for 6 \\nmonths has similar efficiency to danazol, but the second course cannot be \\ngiven due to risk of osteoporosis. \\niv) Central Precocious Puberty: \\nNafarelin blocks \\nbreast and genital \\ndevelopment in girls a nd boys.

It is recommended for long-term Gn suppression, like \\nin endometriosis, precocious puberty\\n, carcinoma prostate, and uterine \\nleiomyoma. It is given along with an androgen antagonist (like flutamide or \\nbicalutamide) for preventing the initial burst of prostate tumour that occurs  \\nbecause in the first 1-2 weeks due to increased secretion of gonadotropin.  \\n \\n7.2.5.5. \\nGonadotropin Inhibitors \\nThe more extensively replaced GnRH analogues act as \\nantagonists of GnRH \\nreceptor. They inhibit secretion of gonadotropin without initial stimulation. The \\nGnRH antagonists used before produce only limited reactions because of histamine \\nrelease, while the newer agents like ganirelix and cetrorelix can release low levels \\nof histamine thus, are used in specific centres to inhibit LH surges while \\ncontrolling ovarian stimulation in women going through in vitro fertilisation. \\n \\nThe advantages of GnRH antagonists over the long-acting GnRH agonists are:  \\n1) They can rapid ly suppress gonadotropins by competitive antagonism , and \\nshould be started from the 6th day of ovarian hyperstimulation. \\n2) They possess a lower risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. \\n3) They attain complete suppression of endogenous gonadotropin secretion. \\n \\n7.2.5.6. \\nGonadotropin Abnormalities \\nThe disturbances in secretion of gonadotropins from pituitary cause delayed or \\nprecocious puberty in girls and boys. \\nInsufficient secretion of gonadotropins \\ncauses am enorrhoea and sterility in women , and impotency, oligozoospermia, \\nand infertility in men.

POSTERIOR PITUITARY HORMONES \\n \\n7.3.1. \\nIntroduction \\nTwo hormones, Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH, vasopressin) and oxytocin are \\nsecreted by the posterior pituitary lobe. Both are synthesised in hypothalamus \\nand stored in the posterior pituitary gland as there are interconnecting nerve \\nfibres between the hypothalamus and posterior pituitary gland.  In contrast to the \\nhormones secreted from the  anterior pituitary lobe, the hormones from the  \\nposterior lobe are not controlled by releasing hormones. They are produced in the \\nhypothalamus, conveyed to the posterior pituitary, and released in response to \\nspecific physiological signals like high plasma osmolarity or parturition.  \\n \\nEach hormone secreted from posterior pituitary lobe \\nis a circular nonapeptide \\nbecause of a bisulphide bridge. These hormones can be inactivated by the \\nreduction of disulphide. They are \\nsensitive to proteolytic cleavage , and thus, \\ngiven via parenteral route. They have short half-lives. \\n', 'link': []}, 185: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n185 \\n*  \\n* \\n7.3.2. \\nVasopressin (Anti-Diuretic Hormone, ADH) \\nVasopressin is a neurohypophysial hormone present in most mammals . It has \\narginine in most of the species and is also called Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) or \\nargipressin. It retains water and constricts blood vessels. Water retention in body is \\ncontrolled by vasopressin that increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of \\n kidneys (tubules which collects the dilute urine produced by the nephrons).  \\nMagnocellular cells of the hypothalamus produce vasopressin. These cells contain \\nosmoreceptors which sense differences in extracellular osmolality. Secretion of \\nvasopressin from the nerve terminals in posterior pituitary is stimulated by elevated \\nosmolality. Vasopressin binds to V1 and V 2 receptors. The former are located in \\nsystemic arterioles and mediate va soconstriction, while the latter  are located in \\nnephrons and increases water reabsorption in the collecting duct by stimulating cell \\nsurface expression of water channels. These two actions of vasopressin add up to \\nmaintain vascular tone by increasing blood pressure\\n and water reabsorption. \\n \\n7.3.2.1. \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nPosterior pituitary gland secretes vasopressin due to reduced plasma volume, \\nincreased plasma osmolality, and \\nsecretion of  cholecystokinin (CCK) by the \\nsmall intestine: \\n1) The pressure receptors (baroreceptors) in the ve ins, atria, and carotid sinuses \\nstimulate the secretion of vasopressin in response to reduced plasma volume.  \\n2) The osmoreceptors of hypothalamus stimulate the secretion of vasopressin in \\nresponse to elevated plasma osmotic pressure.  \\n3) Increased plasma CCK \\nstimulates the  secretion of vasopres\\nsin by an \\nunknown pathway. \\n \\nThe neurons making AVP in the hypothalamic Supraoptic Nuclei (SON) and \\nParaventricular Nuclei (PVN) are osmoreceptors, and they also collect synaptic \\ninput from other osmoreceptors present near the anterior wall of the third ventricle \\n (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the sub-fornical organ).  \\nThe following factors influence the secretion of vasopressin: \\n1) Ethanol \\nblocks the voltage\\n-gated calcium channels present in \\nneurohypophyseal nerve terminal in rats, thus \\ndecreases the \\ncalcium-\\ndependent secretion of AVP.  \\n2) Angiotensin II increases AVP secretion and maintains its general pressor and \\npro-volumic effects on the body. \\n3) AVP secretion is inhibited by atrial natriuretic peptide, partially by inhibiting \\nthe stimulation of AVP secretion induced by angiotensin II. \\n \\n7.3.2.2. \\nPhysiological Actions  \\nThe physiological actions of vasopressin are shown: \\n1) Effects on Kidney s: The major effect of vasopressin is conserving body \\nwater by decreasing the loss of water through urine. An agent whic\\nh \\nincreases the rate of urine formation is called diuretic. When small amounts \\nof antidiuretic hormone are injected, anti\\n-diuresis (decreased formation of \\nurine) occurs.  \\n', 'link': []}, 186: {'text': '186 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nVasopressin increases water reabsorption back into the circulation by binding \\nto the receptors present on the cells in the collecting ducts. The se ducts are \\nimpermeable to water in the absence of vasopressin, and it flows out as urine. \\nVasopressin also increases water reabsorption by the stimulation of insertion \\nof water channels (or aquaporins) in the membranes of kidney tubules. \\n \\nThese water channels decrease plasma osmolality and increase osmolality of \\nurine by transporting solute free water \\nthrough tubular cells and back into \\nblood.  \\n2) Effects on Vascular System: In many species, increased concentration of \\nvasopressin causes constriction of arterioles that further increases\\n arterial \\npressure. Vasopressin exhibits negligible pressor effects in healthy humans. \\n \\n7.3.2.3. \\nUses \\nThe uses of vasopressin are:  \\n1) It mediates aspects of social behaviour, e.g., monogamous and promiscuous \\nanimal species have different patterns of vasopressin receptor distribution in \\nthe brain.  \\n2) It mediates aggressive behaviour. \\n3) It is involved in aspects of memory. \\n4) It is involved in central regulation of temperature and blood pressure. \\n \\n7.3.2.4. \\nVasopressin Abnormalities \\nDiabetes insipidus is the most common disease related to \\nvasopressin. This \\ncondition occurs due to either of the two conditions: \\n1) Less secretion of \\nvasopressin from the posterior pituitar\\ny causes \\nhypothalamic (“central”) diabetes insipidus due to head trauma, and traumas \\nor infections concerning hypothalamus. \\n2) When the  kidneys fail to respond to vasopressin, nephrogenic diabetes \\ninsipidus occurs due to some renal disease , or mutations in th e vasopressin \\nreceptor gene or in the gene encoding aquaporin-2.   \\n \\nExcessive urine production is the primary symptom of diabetes insipidus. Some \\npatients produce 16 litres of urine /day. The disease is barely life-threatening if \\nsufficient amount of drinking water is available, however, withholding water can \\nbe very risky.  \\n \\nExogenous antidiuretic hormone can be used for treating hypothalamic diabetes \\ninsipidus. Vasopressin is evolving as a major advancement for treating \\nseptic \\nshock. Vasoconstriction is fa cilitated by vasopressin through activation of  V1 \\nreceptors on vascular smooth muscle. \\n \\nPlasma vasopressin concentrations are increased in septic shock patients using \\ninfusions of 0.01–0.04 U/min vasopressin. This increase is related to the reduced \\nrequirements of other vasopressors. Greater blood flow diversion from non -vital \\nto vital \\norgan beds has been demonstrated using va\\nsopressin than with \\nadrenaline.  \\n', 'link': []}, 187: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n187 \\n*  \\n* \\n7.4. THYROID HORMONES \\n \\n7.4.1. \\nIntroduction \\nTwo hormones, i.e., thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are synthesised \\nby the thyroid gland. Both the hormones have high concentrations of iodine, and \\n both are assumed as a tyrosine derivative.  \\nThyroxine (T 4) is the foremost thyroid hormone in the blood, with half\\n-life \\nlonger than T3. The ratio of T4 to T3, released in the human blood ranges between \\n14:1 and 20:1. Deiodinases (5‟-iodinase) converts T4 into the active T3 (3-4 times \\nmore efficient than T\\n4). Iodothyronamine (T\\n1a) and thyronamine (T\\n0a) are \\nproduced by processing of T 4 and T3 through decarboxylation and deiodination. \\nDietary selenium is \\nimportant for T 3 production, as all three isoforms of \\n deiodinases enzymes contain selenium.   \\nThyroid hormone r eceptors are theoretically similar to the \\nsteroid hormone \\nreceptors. They are intrac ellular DNA-binding proteins which act as hormone -\\nresponsive transcription factors. \\n \\n7.4.2. \\nSynthesis, Storage, Release, and Metabolism \\nThyroid follicle is the functional unit of thyroid gland. It has a cavity lined with a \\nsingle epithelial cell layer, and the lumen is filled with thyroglobulin.

The iodinated \\nthyroglobulin is secreted into the follicular lumen for storage.   \\n2) Release: The iodinated thyroglobulin is taken back by the follicle cells in the \\npresence of thyro tropin by endocytosis. These follicle cells  consume some \\nthyroglobulin colloid. PROTEOLYTIC enzymes then act on this colloid for \\nreleasing thyroid hormones in\\nto the circulation. T\\n4 is released  in major \\nquantity (80%) and is deiodinated in the peripheral tissues into active T3. \\n3) Transport: T4 and T3 are highly bound to plasma proteins; small amounts \\nare bound to thyroxine -binding albumin  and a major amount is bound to \\nThyroxine-Binding Globulin (TBG). \\nOral contraceptives, clofibrate, \\noestrogens, neuroleptics, and pregnancy  increase the concentrations of \\nthyroxine-binding proteins , while androgens, corticosteroids, and anabolic \\nsteroids lower the concentration . Thyroid hormones are displaced from the \\nplasma protein binding sites by phenytoin and salicylates. \\n4) Metabolism: T4 is partially deiodinated into active T\\n3 or reverse T 3 (rT3). \\nThyroid hormones ultimately undergo \\ndeiodination (in the liver), \\ndeamination, and partial conjugation. The f\\nree and conjugated metabolites \\nare excreted in bile and urine.  \\n \\n7.4.3. \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nHypothalamus releases the\\n Thyrotrophin-Releasing Hormone (TRH) \\nthat \\ncontrols the secretion of TSH from the anterior pituitary  gland. The basal TSH \\nrelease is reduced by somatostatin. TSH production is also affected by a negative \\nfeedback effect created by thyroid hormones  (T3 is more active than T 4). Thus, \\nTSH secretion is controlled through the equilibrium between \\nthe actions of T4 \\nand TRH, and \\nalso by somatostatin ; however, even high concentrations of \\n thyroid hormone cannot completely block TSH secretion.  \\nThe foremost second messenger of TSH is cAMP, and it acts on the receptors of \\nthyroid follicle cells. cAMP controls all the steps of thyroid hormone synthesis: \\n1) It stimulates the transcription of Na\\n+/I– transporter gene for iodide uptake \\nthrough the follicular cells. This is the major mechanism through which it \\ncontrols thyroid function.  \\n2) It regulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroglobulin. \\n3) It regulates H2O2 generation and tyrosine iodination. \\n4) It regulates endocytosis and proteolysis of thyroglobulin. \\n5) It regulates the secretion of T3 and T4. \\n6) It regulates blood flow through the thyroid gland. \\n \\nTSH stimulates the action of genes for thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase, and Na+/I– \\ntransporter. It also has a trophic action on thyroid cells.  \\n', 'link': []}, 189: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n189 \\n*  \\n* \\nPlasma iodide concentration also affects the thyroid function. Around 100nmol T4 \\nis synthesised every day, imposing the gland to take almost 500nmol iodide (equal \\nto about 70mg iodine) every day.

Due \\nto lack of iodide, the thyroid \\ngland becomes extremely large and \\nthis \\ncondition is called goitre. \\n2) Hyperthyroidism: It occurs due to excessive secretion of thyroid hormones. \\nThe most common hyperthyroidism condition in humans is Grave’s Disease, \\nwhich is an immune diseas e in which auto -antibodies bind  to the thyroid \\nstimulating hormone receptor\\ns and activates them\\n, thus resulting  in \\ncontinuous stimulation of thyroid hormone synthesis\\n. A rare condition  of \\nhyperthyroidism is hamburger thyrotoxicosis. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism \\ninclude nervousness, insomnia, high heart rate, eye disease, and anxiety.  \\n \\nGrave’s disease is treated using anti-thyroid drugs (e.g., propylthiourea and \\nmethimazole) that act by\\n suppressing thyroid hormone \\nsynthesis by \\ninterfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin by thyroid peroxidase. \\n \\n7.4.7. \\nThyroid Hormone Inhibitors \\nThyroid hormo ne inhibitors \\nare hormone antagonists that act on thyroid \\nhormones.

This is one of the major steps in thyroxine (T\\n4) production. \\nThe sodium -dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cell‟s \\nbasolateral membranes is not inhibited by \\npropylthiouracil.

HORMONES \\nREGULATING \\nPLASMA \\nCALCIUM LEVEL \\n \\n7.5.1. \\nIntroduction \\nThree hormones, calcitonin, Parathormone (PTH), and calcit riol (active form of \\nvitamin D) are wholly responsible for regul\\nating the plasma calcium levels\\n. \\nThese hormones control the intestinal absorption, exchange with bone, and renal \\nexcretion of plasma calcium. Many drugs, other hormones, and metabolites also \\n influence calcium homeostasis. \\nThe plasma calcium level is 9\\n-11mg/dl, of which 40% is\\n bound to  plasma \\nproteins (mainly albumin), 10% forms an un-separable complex with phosphate, \\ncarbonate, and citrate , and the remaining 50% is ionised and physiologically \\nessential. For example, the total plasma calcium is low but the concentration of \\nCa2+ ion is normal in hypoalbuminemia . Ionisation of calcium is favoured by \\nacidosis and disfavoured by alkalosis. In \\ndeficient cases  of calcium, \\nhyperventilation reduces ionisation and causes tetany and laryngospasm. \\n \\nPharmacokinetics \\nCalcium is absorbed \\nfrom small intestine and duodenum \\nthrough facilitated \\ndiffusion and carrier-mediated active transport  (under the influence of vitamin \\nD), respectively . Calcium forms an insolu ble complex in the intestines with \\nphytates, phospha tes, oxalates , and tetracyclines; this complex \\naffects calcium \\n absorption, which is also reduced by phenytoin and glucocorticoids.  \\nThe ionised calcium undergoes glomerular filtration  and a major part of\\n it \\nundergoes tubular reabsorption . Proximal tubular reabsorption of calcium is \\nreduced by c alcitonin and enhanced by vitamin D , whereas its distal tubular \\nreabsorption is enhanced by PTH. Almost 300mg of endogenous calcium is daily \\nexcreted half in urine and half in faeces. For maintaining calcium balance, \\nthe \\nsame amount of dietary calcium should be absorbed in the small intestine. The \\ndiet should provide 0.8-1.5gm/day of calcium, as only 1/3rd of ingested calcium is \\nabsorbed. But, the fractional calcium \\nabsorption is increased due to calcium \\ndeficiency and low dietary calcium. \\n  \\n7.5.2. \\nParathormone (Parathyroid Hormone, PTH) \\nPTH is secreted by the\\n chief cells  of parathyroid glands. It is a \\npolypeptide \\ncontaining 84 amino acids. PTH plays a significan t role in bone remodelling  (a \\ncontinuous process involving alternate resorption and rebuilding of bone tissue \\nover time ). The bones serve as a calcium reservoir from which the body can \\nwithdraw calcium whenever need for maintaining sufficient amount of calcium in \\n the blood. PTH enables this removal of calcium.  \\nAs a resul t, PTH is important for health; and the health problems that result in \\ndeficient or excessive production of\\n PTH (like hyperparathyroidism, \\nhypoparathyroidism, or paraneoplastic syndromes) \\ncan cause bone disease, \\nhyperkalaemia, and hypocalcaemia. \\n', 'link': [{'kind': 2, 'xref': 5473, 'from': Rect(143.44996643066406, 503.77001953125, 194.99996948242188, 516.4199829101562), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_chief_cell', 'id': ''}, {'kind': 2, 'xref': 5401, 'from': Rect(335.1399841308594, 503.77001953125, 394.64996337890625, 516.4199829101562), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypeptide', 'id': ''}, {'kind': 2, 'xref': 5329, 'from': Rect(94.65396881103516, 516.4199829101562, 155.85997009277344, 529.0700073242188), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids', 'id': ''}]}, 195: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n195 \\n*  \\n* \\n7.5.2.1. \\nSynthesis \\nPTH is produced as a 115 -amino acid polypeptide , called as pre-pro-PTH (90 \\namino acids) that is later cleaved in the parathyroid cells at the N\\n-terminal t o \\nyield pro-PTH (90 amino acids) and then PTH (84 amino acids). This obtained  \\nPTH is the major storage, biologically active, and secreted form of the hormone. \\nThis biosynthetic process takes less than an hour\\n. The N-terminal cleaved pre-\\nsequence contains l\\narge amounts of hydrophobic amino acids, which are \\nimportant for transporting into endoplasmic reticulum, whereas, the basic pro\\n-\\npeptide assists precise cleavage of pro -PTH into the mature 1-84 molecule.

This condition is characterised by kidney stones, bone \\ndecalcification, and chronic elevations of blood calcium concentration \\n(hyperkalaemia).  \\n2) Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs due to excessive secretion of PTH  \\nas a res ult of any diseased organ (other than the  parathyroid gland ). \\nGenerally this condition is caused when the kidneys cannot reabsorb calcium, \\nthus the blood calcium levels decline and PTH is secreted constantly  for \\nmaintaining the blood calcium levels.  \\n \\n3) Insufficient nutrition, like dietary insufficiency of calcium or vitamin D, or \\ndiet containing excessive phosphorous (e.g., all meat diets for carnivores) can \\nalso cause secondary hyperparathyroidism.

These conditions reduce the mineralisation of newly \\nsynthesised bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency also occurs in the following  \\nsituations: \\n1) Genetic D efects in Vitamin D Receptor:\\n Various mutations have been \\nrecognised in humans, which results in hereditary vitamin D resistance.  \\n2) Severe Liver or Kidney Disease:\\n This can affect the \\nproduction of the  \\nbiologically-active form of vitamin D. \\n3) Insufficient Exposure to Sunlight: People not taking sufficient sunlight and \\nhaving poor diets suffer from a sub-clinical shortage of vitamin D.  \\n \\n7.5.4.9. \\nVitamin D Toxicity \\nExtreme exposure to sunlight does not produce more vitamin D. \\nInstead, \\noverdosing of vitamin D supplements\\n results in v itamin D toxicity.

INSULIN, \\nORAL \\nHYPOGLYCAEMIC \\nAGENTS AND GLUCAGON \\n \\n7.6.1. \\nIntroduction \\nInsulin is a polypeptide having 51 amino acids organised in two chains attached \\ntogether with disulphide bonds; chain A consists of 21 amino acids and chain B \\nconsists of 30 amino acids. Insulin is synthesised by the pancreatic β-cells from a \\nsingle chain precursor , called proinsulin.  The amino acid sequence of insulin \\nvaries in different species.  \\n', 'link': []}, 203: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n203 \\n*  \\n* \\nThe major disadvantage of insulin is that it needs to be injected; thus, \\noral \\nhypoglycaemic drugs  are used to \\ndecrease blood glucose  levels. Oral \\nhypoglycaemic drugs are used in the \\ndiagnosis of insulinoma  and diabetes \\ninsipidus. \\n \\nGlucagon is a hormone released by the \\n\\uf061-cells of the islets of Langerhans in \\npancreas. It acts opposite to insulin, thus increases the blood glucose levels.  \\n \\n7.6.2. \\nInsulin \\nInsulin injection is used for controlling blood sugar in \\ntype 1 diabetic patients  \\n(situation in which the body cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood as it \\ndoes not produce insulin) or in type 2 \\ndiabetic patients (situation in which the \\nblood sugar is too high as the \\nbody cannot produce or use insulin normally)\\n, \\nwhen they do not respond to oral medications. \\n \\nInsulin injection is used to replace the insulin produced in the body. It moves the \\nsugar from blood to other body tissues where it is utilised for producing energy. \\nIt also inhibits sugar production in liver.  \\n \\nAll the available types of insulin act in this way. The only difference in \\ninsulin \\ntypes is in their onset of action and the duration for which they can control blood \\nsugar.  \\n \\n7.6.2.1. \\nInsulin Preparations \\nThe different types of insulin preparations are given in the table 7.3: \\n \\nTable 7.3: Different Types of Insulin Preparations \\nTypes \\nOnset \\n(hrs) \\nPeak \\n(hrs) \\nDuration \\n(hrs) \\nShort Acting Insulin \\ni) \\nCrystalline soluble insulin \\nii) \\nAmorphous insulin zinc suspension (Semilente) \\n \\n0.30-1 \\n0.30-1 \\n \\n2 \\n8 \\n \\n5-8 \\n12-16 \\nIntermediate Acting Insulin \\ni) \\nGlobin zinc insulin \\nii) \\nInsulin zinc Preparation (Lente) \\niii) Isophane insulin suspension \\n \\n1-4 \\n1-4 \\n1-2 \\n \\n6-10 \\n6-8 \\n10-12 \\n \\n16-24 \\n24-30 \\n24-30 \\nLong Acting Insulin \\ni) \\nProtamine zinc suspension \\nii) \\nExtended insulin zinc crystalline (Ultralente) \\n \\n8 \\n7 \\n \\n14-16 \\n14-16 \\n \\n30-36 \\n34-36 \\n \\n7.6.2.2. \\nSynthesis \\nInsulin is produced in sufficient amount by the β-cells of pancreas. The insulin \\nmRNA is translated as a single chain precursor, known as pre-pro-insulin, and \\npro-insulin is generated by the removal of its signal peptide while getting \\ninserted into the endoplasmic reticulum.  \\n \\n', 'link': []}, 204: {'text': '204 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nPro-insulin is made up of three domains, a carboxy terminal A-chain, an amino \\nterminal B -chain, and a C-peptide (connecting peptide ) in the middle\\n  \\n(figure 7.11). In the  endoplasmic reticulum, the mature form of insulin is \\ngenerated by removing the C -peptide from the pro-insulin exposed to specific \\nendopeptidases.

This is\\n because the orally administered \\nglucose stimulates the production of \\nsecretin, gastrin and pancreozymin (\\ngut \\ndigestive hormones ), which further stimulate secretion of insulin. The i slet β-\\nreceptors also modulate insulin secretion.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTherefore, \\uf062-adrenergic agonists (like adrenaline) increases insulin secretion by \\nincreasing intracellular cAMP. On the contrary, i\\nnsulin release is reduced by \\nadrenergic \\uf061-receptors.   \\n \\nGlucose stimulates insulin release in two phases. The first phase is an initial \\nburst phase which reaches the peak within minutes and declines quickly, and the \\nsecond slow phase reaches the peal in an hour. Daily production of insulin ranges \\nbetween 30 and 40 units. Insulin in its free state circulates in the blood and lymph. \\nHepatic and renal proteolytic enzymes degrade insulin. Nearly 40% of the daily \\nproduced insulin is damaged and only some part is excreted unchanged in urine.  \\n \\n7.6.2.4. \\nMechanism of Action \\nInsulin acts by binding with high affinity and selectivity to several insulin \\nreceptors present on cell membranes. The formed insulin-receptor complex enters \\nthe cell where insulin is released. The receptors differ inversely to insulin \\nconcentrations in plasma . T hese receptors are reduced in number (down\\n-\\nregulated) during high concentration of insulin, while they are increased in \\nnumber (up-regulated) during low concentration of insulin. This results in \\ndecreased and increased responsiveness to insulin, respectively. \\n \\nOther than the number of receptors, their reduced affinity for insulin also adds to \\ninsulin resistance. Thus in type II diabetes, reduced body weight can restore the \\nresponsiveness to insulin  produced within the body by up\\n-regulating and \\nincreasing affinity for insulin by these receptors.  \\nFigure 7.12: Regulation of Secretion of Insulin from β-Islet Cells \\nMetabolism \\nAT\\nP \\n+ + + + + \\n+ + + + \\n+ + + \\nCalcium channel \\nCa2+ \\n (Open; depolarisation) \\nTransporters (GLUT 1-5) \\nGlucose \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ \\n+ + \\nK+ \\nK+ \\nSulfonylureas (close channel) \\nPotassium channel \\nMyosin \\nfilaments \\nwith insulin \\nCloses; \\ndepolarisation \\nInsulin  \\n', 'link': []}, 206: {'text': '206 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nThe insulin receptor is made up  of an extracellular α-subunit (recognition site) \\nand a β-subunit covering the cell membrane, and \\ncontaining tyrosine kinase \\nwhich forms the second messenger system.

Thus, \\nfats are used as a fuel, whose by-products, i.e., ketones accumulate in the body. \\n3) Diabetic Coma:  This condition is manifested by \\nsevere hyperglycaemia, \\ndehydration (because of osmotic glucose diuresis\\n), hypovolemic and \\nhyperosmolality. Insulin and normal saline infusion (2 litres in 1\\n-2 hours) \\nfollowed by half -strength saline (0.45%) infusion are used for  rehydration. \\nPotassium su pplements and heparin (patients are prone to intravascular \\nthrombosis) are also used. \\n4) Hyperkalaemia: Insulin (1 unit/3gm glucose) stimulates intracellular influx \\nof potassium when given intravenously with 300-500ml 20% glucose.  \\n5) Diagnosis: Insulin test determines the anterior pituitary function (rise in GH \\nand ACTH) and entirety of vagotomy (reduced gastric acid response).  \\n \\n7.6.2.7. \\nDrug Interactions \\nVarious drugs interact with insulin and \\nchange its ability of decreasing blood \\nglucose levels: \\n1) The hypoglycaemic effect of in\\nsulin is increased with salicylates, \\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), anabolic steroids, and alcohol.  \\n2) The insulin effects are reduced and h\\nyperglycaemia occurs \\nwith \\ndextrothyroxine sodium, corticosteroids, thiazide d\\niuretics, \\nand \\nsympathomimetic drugs. \\n3) The hypoglycaemic effects of insulin \\nare extended  and the signs and \\nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia are hidden by β-adrenergic blockers.  \\n \\n7.6.2.8. \\nInsulin Analogues \\nFollowing are the analogues of insulin: \\n1) Insulin Lispro (Humalog): It is a prescription-only rapid-acting insulin with \\na faster onset of action and \\nshorter duration of action in comparis on to  \\nregular insulin.

It should not be shaken before \\nuse as it may produce air bubbles. It is given 30-60 minutes before a meal.

These effects may partially be \\nbecause of unrestricted actions of diabetogenic hormones like growth hormones, \\nglucagon, adrenaline, and glucocorticoids. Ketoacidosis and hyperlipaemia \\noccur due to enhanced breakdown of lipids and increase d plasma free fatty acid \\nlevels that consequently increases the blood levels of acetoacetate, ketones, and \\nβ-hydroxybutyrate. Increased gluconeogenesis \\noccurs as a result of \\nthe \\nstimulation of protein catabolism. \\n \\n7.6.3. \\nOral Hypoglycaemic Agents \\nHypoglycaemic agents are used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus by lowering \\nthe blood glucose levels. With the exceptions of insulin, exenatide, liraglutide \\nand pramlintide, all the other hypoglycaemic agents are administered orally and \\nare therefore known as oral hypoglycaemic agents or oral anti-hyperglycaemic \\nagents. \\n \\nDiabetes may be of the following two types:  \\n1) Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 is caused due to the lack of insulin. Insulin should \\nbe used in Type 1 through injections. \\n2) Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 is caused due to insulin resistance by cells. It is \\nthe most common type of diabetes and can be treated by using:  \\ni) The agents increasing insulin secretion by the pancreas,  \\nii) The agents increasing sensitivity of target organs to insulin, and  \\niii) The a gents decreasing the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the \\ngastrointestinal tract. \\n', 'link': [{'kind': 2, 'xref': 5257, 'from': Rect(77.65696716308594, 463.3699951171875, 115.75797271728516, 476.010009765625), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose', 'id': ''}, {'kind': 2, 'xref': 5181, 'from': Rect(258.3399658203125, 463.3699951171875, 292.78997802734375, 476.010009765625), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin', 'id': ''}]}, 209: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n209 \\n*  \\n* \\n7.6.3.1. \\nClassification \\nHypoglycaemic agen ts are classified into various classes and their selection \\ndepends on the type and extent of diabetes, age and condition of person, etc.  \\n \\nClasses \\nFirst Generation \\nSecond Generation \\nSulfonylureas \\nTolbutamide, \\nChlorpropamide \\nGlibenclamide (Glyburide)  \\nGlipizide, Gliclazide, Glimepride \\nBiguanides \\nPhenformin \\nMetformin \\nMeglitinide Analogues \\nRepaglinide \\nNateglinide \\nThiazolidinediones \\nRosiglitazone \\nPioglitazone \\n\\uf061 Glucosidase Inhibitors \\nAcarbose \\nMiglitol \\n \\n \\n7.6.3.2. \\nSulfonylureas \\nJanbon and colleagues\\n in 1942 unintentionally determined that some \\nsulphonamides were causing hyperglycaemia in the experimental \\nanimals.

It is used for \\ncontrolling the meal time deviation of glucose. It is not a sulfonylurea, still it acts \\nin a similar way by binding with sulfonylurea receptors and also to other diverse \\nreceptors, and closes ATP dependent K+ channels followed by depolarisation and \\n release of insulin.  \\nRepaglinide is taken before each major meal for controlling the postprandial \\nhyperglycaemia.

It acts opposite to insulin, thus increases \\n the blood glucose levels.  \\nWhen blood sugar (glucose) levels decrease too much, the pancreas releases \\nglucagon. In the presence of glucagon, liver converts the glycogen into glucose \\nand releases in the bloodstream. The release of insulin is stimulated by high \\nblood glucose levels. Insulin allows the uptake and use of glucose by the insulin -\\ndependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin retain the blood glucose at a stable \\nlevel, by being a part of feedback system. \\n \\n7.6.4.1. \\nSynthesis \\nGlucagon is synthesised by the pancreatic α-cells as well as by the GIT (nearly \\n1/3rd of the circulating glucagon). When compared to other polypeptide hormones, \\nno noticeable change \\nhas been noticed in the structure of glucagon \\nduring \\nevolution. The sequence of pre -pro-glucagon depends on the nucleotide sequence \\nof cloned cDNA, and its structure consists of a pre signal, a pro, N-terminal peptide \\nknown as Glicentin-Related Pancreatic Peptide (GRPP), two carboxy terminal \\npeptides known as Glucagon-Like Peptides (GLP-I and GLP-II), and glucagon. \\nBoth GLP-I and GLP-II levels are raised after meal, similar to glucagon. \\n \\n7.6.4.2. \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nThe primary effect of glucagon is to raise the blood glucose \\nlevels; it is \\nunderstandable that glucagon is re leased as a re sponse to hypoglycaemia. Two \\nother conditions that trigger the secretion of glucagon are: \\n1) Elevated Blood Levels of Amino Acids (After Consumption of a Protein -\\nRich Meal):  In this condition, glucagon \\nincreases gluconeogenesis and \\nfacilitates the conversion of excess amino acids into glucose. This will be a \\ncondition during which both insulin and glucagon are active\\n, as insulin \\nrelease is stimulated by high blood levels of amino acids.  \\n2) Exercise: It is unclear i f exercise is the real stimulus\\n or the associated \\nexercise-induced glucose depletion is the main cause of glucagon secretion. \\n \\nWith reference to negative control, high levels of blood glucose prevent glucagon \\nsecretion. It is unclear if this shows the direct effect of glucose on the α-cells, or \\nan effect of insulin that \\nsuppresses glucagon release. Somatostatin is \\nanother \\nhormone that inhibits glucagon secretion.  \\n \\n7.6.4.3. \\nMechanism of Action \\nGlucagon binds to a glucagon receptor, which is a G-protein coupled receptor \\npresent on the plasma membrane. This receptor goes through a conformational change \\nwhich activates adenylate cyclase, when the G-protein and the receptor interact.  \\n \\nAdenylate cyclase produces \\ncAMP that activates  protein kinase A  enzyme \\n(cAMP-dependent protein kinase) . This enzyme prod\\nuces phosphorylase A \\nenzyme that assists in releasing glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen polymers.  \\n', 'link': []}, 214: {'text': '214 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\n7.6.4.4. \\nPhysiological Actions \\nThe major physiological actions of glucagon include: \\n1) Metabolic Effects: Glucagon infusion quickly increases the blood glucose \\nby increasing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver. It stimulates \\nadenylyl cyclase in the adipose tissue and enhances lipolysis. \\nTherapeutic \\ndoses of glucagon are responsible for releasing calcitonin from medullary \\ncarcinoma cells, insulin from normal p\\nancreatic cells, and catecholamines \\nfrom pheochromocytoma. Glucagon is also important in the development of \\nketoacidosis.  \\n2) Cardiac Effects: Glucagon exerts potent inotropic and chronotropic effects \\n(mediated by the cAMP) on the heart . Therefore, its effect s are identical to \\nthose produced by \\uf062-adrenoceptor agonists, which require active \\uf062-receptors. \\n3) Effects on Smooth Muscle\\ns: High doses of glucagon produce deep \\nrelaxation in the intestines. As compared to the  other effects of peptide , this \\neffect on the intestines is because of the mechanisms not involving activation \\nof adenylyl cyclase. \\n4) Other Effects:  \\ni) Glucagon is the most effective glycogenolytic hormone that induces a \\nfast increase in blood glucose. \\nii) In healthy people, it is the second defence against hypo glycaemia; the \\nfirst is plasma insulin level reduction because of reduction in blood \\nglucose concentration. The latter one is not active in patients taking \\ninsulin or an oral hypoglycaemic drug.  \\niii) Glucagon stimulates lipolysis in the peripheral tissues, whi ch further \\nstimulates ketogenesis. Glucagon also increases neoglucogenesis when \\nglucocorticoids are available.  \\niv) It increases the release of insulin from β-cells, and it has been reported \\nthat it also takes part in the release of insulin following ingestion\\n of \\nglucose.  \\n \\n7.6.4.5. \\nUses \\nGlucagon is used in the following conditions:  \\n1) Severe Hypoglycaemia: It is mainly used during emergency treatment of \\nserious hypoglycaemic conditions in insulin\\n-dependent patients.

ACTH \\n(CORTICOTROPIN \\nOR \\nADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE) \\n \\n7.7.1. \\nIntroduction \\nACTH is a polypeptide hormone which controls the secretions of adrenal cortex \\nand is released by the chromophobe cells of pituitary gland. Cor\\nticotropin-\\nReleasing Hormone (CRH) is responsible for the production \\nand release of \\nproopiomelanocortin (a peptide) from hypothalamus. ACTH is produced by post-\\ntranslational processing of this precursor  polypeptide. Other products include \\uf067-\\nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone and \\uf062-lipotropin (the precursor of endorphins ). \\nGenerally, ACTH is released by the pituitary in pulses with a dominant diurnal \\nrhythm; the highest concentration occurs at almost 6  AM, and the lowest occurs \\nin the evening. ACTH secretion is increased by stress and decreased by cortisol.   \\n \\n7.7.2. \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nSecretion of  ACTH is controlled by  the hypothalamic Corticotropin -Releasing \\nFactor (CRF) that is released under the influence of emotion, stress, trauma, and \\ndiurnal rhythms. CRF further stimulates the \\nsynthesis and release of ACTH\\n. \\nVasopressin and catecholamine also stimulate ACTH secretion. On the other \\nhand, ACTH secretion is suppressed by adrenal corticosteroids (glucoc orticoids), \\neither by direct action or by inhibiting CRF release. \\n \\nThe former is the short negative feedback loop , while the latter is the long \\nnegative feedback loop .

These hormones are synthesised in the adrenal \\ncortex, having \\nsteroidal structure and act by binding to the Glucocorticoid Receptors (GR).  \\n \\nGCs are the component of the feedback mechanism in the immune system that \\ndecreases the immune activity (inflammation).

Excessive glucocorticoids result in redistribution of fat in \\nthe body and hyperlipidaemia. \\n2) Stress: Glucocorticoids increase the plasma glucose levels and \\nprovide \\nenergy required to combat stress due to trauma, fright, infection, bleeding, or \\ndebilitating disease. They improve the vaso constrictor action of adrenergic \\nstimuli on small vessels.  \\n3) Blood Cells : Glucocorticoids reduce the  levels of eosinophils, basophils, \\nmonocytes, and lymphocytes in blood circulation by redistributing them from the \\ncirculation to lymphoid tissue. Against this effect, they increase the blood levels \\nof haemoglobin, erythrocytes, platelets, and po\\nlymorphonuclear leukocytes.  \\n4) Anti-Inflammatory Action : Glucocorticoids dramatically decrease the \\ninflammatory response and suppress immunity.  \\n5) Endocrine System : Feedback inhibition of corticotropin formation by \\nelevated glucocorticoids results in inhibitio\\nn of further glucocorticoid \\nsynthesis and formation of thyroid -stimulating hormone. In contrast to this \\naction, the production of growth hormone increases. \\n6) Immunity: Glucocorticoids provide immunity \\nby up -regulating the \\nexpression of anti\\n-inflammatory prot eins and by down\\n-regulating the \\nexpression of pro-inflammatory proteins. \\n7) Homeostasis: Glucocorticoids are actively involved in the d evelopment and \\nhomeostasis of T -lymphocytes, along with suppression of all types of \\nhypersensitivity and allergic reactions. \\n \\n7.8.3.5. \\nUses \\nGlucocorticoids are used in the treatment of various diseased conditions \\n(table 7.5): \\n \\nTable 7.5: Therapeutic Uses of Glucocorticoids in Non-Adrenal Disorders \\nDisorders \\nExamples \\nAllergy \\nAsthma, drug allergy, contact dermatitis, urticaria, allergic  rhinitis, \\nserum sickness, and angioneurotic oedema. \\nSkin diseases \\nAtopic dermatitis, dermatoses, chronic lichen simplex, pemphigus, \\nmycosis fungoides, xerosis, and seborrheic dermatitis. \\nEye diseases \\nAcute uveitis, allergic conjunctivitis, optic neuritis, and choroiditis. \\nHaematological \\ndisorders \\nLeukaemia, acquired haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune haemolytic \\nanaemia, acute allergic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic \\npurpura, and multiple myeloma. \\nCollagen-\\nvascular disorders \\nLupus erythematosus, rheuma\\ntoid arthritis, polymyositis, \\nand \\nmixed connective tissue syndromes. \\n', 'link': []}, 222: {'text': '222 \\nPharmacology-II  \\n*  \\n* \\nNeurologic \\ndisorders \\nCerebral oedema (large doses of dexamethasone) and \\nmultiple \\nsclerosis. \\nGastrointestinal \\ndisorders \\nInflammatory bowel disease and non-topical sprue. \\nOrgan transplants To prevent and treat graft/transplant rejection. \\nPulmonary \\ndisorders \\nBronchial asthma, prevention of infant respiratory distress \\nsyndrome, aspiration pneumonia, and sarcoidosis. \\nRenal disorders  \\nNephrotic syndrome. \\nThyroid disorders Malignant exophthalmos and sub-acute thyroiditis. \\nBones, joints \\nArthritis, bursitis, and tenosynovitis. \\nInfections  \\nGram-negative septicaemia. \\nMiscellaneous  \\nMountain sickness and hypocalcaemia. \\n \\n7.8.3.6. \\nAdverse Effects \\nNoticeable amounts of undesirable adverse effects occur rarely with low doses of \\nglucocorticoids (prednisolone 10mg or equivalent dose of other glucocorticoids)  \\nfor a few days.

As a result of steroid\\n-receptor \\nbinding, the synthesis of Na+/K+-ATPase is increased, which further enhances the \\nexchange of sodium and potassium in distal tubular epithelium. \\nSimilarly, \\nincrease in sodium re\\nabsorption is enhanced in the colonic epithelium and \\nurinary bladder. The result of a ldosterone-receptor binding is similar to that of \\nglucocorticoids.    \\n \\n7.8.4.3. \\nPharmacokinetics \\nApart from 11-Deoxycorticosterone, all the other natural and synthetic corticoids \\nare effectively absorbed on oral administration . Wat er-soluble esters \\n(like \\nhydrocortisone hemisuccinate , and dexamethasone sodium phosphate\\n) on \\nintravenous or intramuscular administration\\n acts quickly and attains high \\nconcentrations in tissue fluids. Insol uble esters (like hydrocortisone acetate and \\ntriamcinolone acetonide ) on intramuscular administration are absorbed slowly \\n from the injection site and produce more prolonged effects.  \\nHydrocortisone experiences high first pass metabolism, and has low \\noral:parenteral activity ratio. Synthetic oral corticoids have high bioavailability.  \\nHydrocortisone is 90% plasma protein\\n bound, with a major part \\nbound to \\ntranscortin (a Cortisol -Binding Globulin, CBG)  and als o to albumin. The \\nconcentration of transcortin is increased during pregnancy and by the use of oral \\ncontraceptives; thus, the \\ncorticoid levels in blood are increased, but \\n hypercorticism does not occur as free cortisol levels are normal.  \\nCorticosteroids are mainly metabolised by hepatic microsomal enzymes through \\nthe following pathways: \\n1) Reduction of 4,5-double bond and hydroxylation of 3-keto group, \\n2) Reduction of 20-keto to 20-hydroxy form, and \\n3) Oxidative cleavage of 20C side chain (in case of compounds having a 17\\n-\\nhydroxyl group) to yield 17-ketosteroids. \\n \\nThe plasma half-life of hydrocortisone is 1.5 hours , but its biological half-life is \\nlonger due to its action through intracellular receptors and regulation of protein \\nsynthesis. These effects stay for long even after the removal of steroid s from the \\nplasma. \\n \\n7.8.4.4. \\nPhysiological Actions \\nFollowing are the physiological actions of mineralocorticoids: \\n1) Electrolyte and Water Metabolism:\\n Aldosterone enhances sodium \\nresorption and increases the excretion of potassium by the kidney, intestine s, \\nand sweat and salivary g\\nlands. Patients suffering from an aldosterone \\nproducing adenoma (primary hyperaldosteronism), the subject leaks from the \\nsodium retaining effect; but potassium loss remains. \\n \\nIn case of aldosterone deficiency, the distal renal tubule is unable to conserve \\nsodium and there is a significant sodium loss with related osmotic diuresis, \\ncausing decrease in plasma sodium.

As a result, water moves into the cells causing \\nover-hydration. Contraction of the blood volume causes collapse and death.   \\nSimilar effects of aldosterone are seen on cellular sodium transport at other \\nsites, like intestines.  \\n \\n2) Cardiovascular Effects:  Aldosterone helps in blood coagulation, \\ncontraction of systemic arterioles, and stimulation of thirst. It also controls \\nthe inflammatory and reparative processes that occur after tissue injury.  \\n \\n7.8.4.5. \\nUses \\nAldosterone and its synthetic derivatives (\\ne.g., fludrocortisone) are used for \\ntreating Addison‟s disease, salt losing  congenital adrenal  hyperplasia, \\nhyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism as in chronic kidney disease due to dia\\nbetes \\nmellitus and other causes, \\nand severe postural hypotension from autonomic \\nneuropathy of any etiology. \\n \\n7.8.4.6. \\nAdverse Effects \\nAdverse effects are related to the excessive s\\nodium retaining and potassium \\ndepleting actions and also include weight gain, oedema, hypertension\\n, and \\nhypokalaemia. Patients with Addison‟s disease are very sensitive to these effects, \\nand therefore the dose of a mineralocorticoid should be adjusted carefully. \\n \\n7.8.5. \\nCorticosteroid Inhibitors \\nGiven below are the different inhibitors of corticosteroids: \\n1) Synthesis Inhibitors: These drugs are limitedly used in Cushing‟s syndrome \\nor adrenocortical tumours. They can cause acute a\\ndrenal insufficiency, if \\nthey are not cautiously monitored. Some examples of drugs that inhibit  the \\nsynthesis of corticosteroids are: \\ni) Metyrapone: 11β-hydroxylase enzyme is inhibited by this drug, which \\nalso inhibits the production of glucocorticoids. It is used for testing \\nadrenal function.   \\nii) Trilostane: The synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and \\ngonadal hormones is inhibited by this drug. \\niii) Aminoglutethimide: The synthesis of all steroid hormones including sex \\nhormones is inhibited by this drug \\nas it inhibits the conversion of \\ncholesterol into pregnenolone. It is used in breast carcinoma. \\niv) Ketoconazole: The synthesis of adrenocorticoids and sex hormones is \\ninhibited by this drug. It is an orally efficient systemic antifungal which \\nis also used in prostate cancer. \\nv) Mitotane: It exhibits adrenolytic properties , and  has been used in \\nadrenal carcinoma. \\n2) Receptor Antagonist: \\nMifepristone is a pr\\nogesterone antagonist, \\nabortifacient, and an antagonist at glucocorticoid receptors.

SUMMARY \\n \\nThe details given in the chapter can be summarised as follows: \\n1) The endocrine system acts by releasing chemical agents (usually in the blood) \\nand is important for the proper development and functioning of organisms. \\n2) Endocrinology is a branch of a broader field of internal me dicine, and is the \\nstudy of disorders of endocrinal glands. \\n3) The endocrine system comprises of glands which secrete a type of hormone \\nfor regulating the body functions. \\n4) The word hormone has originated from a Greek word \\nhormaein which \\nmeans to impel. \\n5) Pituitary is an essential gland of the body and is generally called as the \\nmaster gland. \\n6) Ghrelin is a peptide hormone secreted from the stomach. \\n7) Somatostatin is a 14 amino acid peptide that can inhibit the secretion of GH, \\nTSH, and prolactin from pituitary gland. \\n8) Lack of growth hormone or defects in its binding with receptors is called as \\ngrowth retardation or dwarfism. \\n9) Gigantism occurs due to excessive GH secretion\\n in young children . It \\noccurs occasionally due to a tumour of somatotropes. \\n10) Acromegaly occurs due to excessive GH secretion  in adults, generally due \\nto benign pituitary tumours. \\n11) Prolactin is a peptide hormone which is secreted by the anterior pituitary \\nand is structurally similar to GH. \\n12) Bromocriptine is a synthetic ergot derivative and a potent dopamine agonist. \\n13) Thyroid stimulating hormone is a \\n210 amino acid\\n and two chain \\nglycoprotein (22% sugar) with a molecular weight of 30000. \\n14) Nafarelin is a long -acting GnRH agonist and is 150 times more effective \\nthan the natural GnRH. \\n15) Two hormones, Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH, vasopressin) and oxytocin \\nare secreted by the posterior pituitary lobe. \\n16) Vasopressin is a neurohypophysial hormone present in most mammals. \\n17) Diabetes insipidus is the most common disease related to vasopressin. \\n18) Two hormones, i.e., \\nthyroxine (T\\n4) and triiodothyronine (T\\n3), are \\nsynthesised by the thyroid gland. \\n19) Thyroid follicle is the functional unit of thyroid gland. \\n20) All cells of the body are possible targets of thyroid hormones. \\n21) Iodine is the component of thyroid hormones but is also the fastest ac\\nting \\nthyroid inhibitor. \\n22) Parathormone is secreted by the  chief cells of parathyroid glands. It is a \\npolypeptide containing 84 amino acids. \\n23) Calcitonin is a 32-amino acid linear polypeptide  hormone which acts \\nopposite to PTH, i.e., it reduces blood calcium levels. \\n', 'link': [{'kind': 2, 'xref': 4577, 'from': Rect(206.70997619628906, 578.81201171875, 257.77996826171875, 593.510986328125), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_chief_cell', 'id': ''}, {'kind': 2, 'xref': 4505, 'from': Rect(48.14997100830078, 593.510986328125, 107.66097259521484, 606.1599731445312), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypeptide', 'id': ''}, {'kind': 2, 'xref': 4433, 'from': Rect(168.8399658203125, 593.510986328125, 229.2699737548828, 606.1599731445312), 'uri': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acids', 'id': ''}]}, 227: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  \\n227 \\n*  \\n* \\n24) The parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland synthesise calcitonin in humans. \\n25) Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that increases the intestinal absorption of \\ncalcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, and phosphate. \\n26) Vitamin D is synthesised in the animal skin when a pr ecursor molecule (7-\\ndehydrocholesterol) absorbs light energy. \\n27) Vitamin D is transported to the liver through blood and gets converted to \\ncalcidiol (the pro-hormone). \\n28) Overdosing of vitamin D supplements results in vitamin D toxicity. \\n29) Insulin is a polypeptide having 51 amino acids  organised in two chains \\nattached together with disulphide bonds; chain A consists of 21 amino acids \\nand chain B consists of 30 amino acids. \\n30) Insulin is recommended to type I diabetic and some kinds of type II diabetic \\npatients. \\n31) Hypoglycaemic agents  are used in the treatment of \\ndiabetes mellitus by \\nlowering the blood glucose levels. \\n32) The first clinically used sulfonylurea for treating diabetes was carbutamide. \\n33) Newly established meglitinide analogues include repaglinide and nateglinide. \\n34) Repaglinide is the first drug of a new class of oral hypoglycaemics. \\n35) Glucagon is a 29 amino acid, single chain polypeptide released by the \\uf061-\\ncells of the islets of Langerhans in pancreas. \\n36) ACTH is a polypeptide hormone which controls the secretions of adrenal \\ncortex and is released by the chromophobe cells of pituitary gland \\n37) Steroids are synthesised mainly in the adrenal gland and also in the \\nsteroidogenic cells of the brain, ovary, testes, and placenta. \\n38) Aldosterone and desoxycorticosterone are the most common examples of \\nnatural mineralocorticoids. \\n \\n7.10.

MALE SEX HORMONES \\n \\n8.1.1. \\nIntroduction \\nSex hormones are synthesised by the gonads. These hormones are required for \\nconception, embryonic maturation, and development of primary and secondary \\nsexual characteristics at the time of puberty. The activity of se\\nx hormones on \\ntarget cells is regulated by the receptors.  \\n \\nTestosterone is a sex hormone, responsible for sexual and reproductive growth in \\nmales. It belongs to a class of male hormones known as androgens (or steroids or \\nanabolic steroids). Testosterone takes part in the growth of male sex organs before \\nbirth, and the growth of secondary sex characters at puberty, like voice deepening, \\nincreased size of penis and testes, and growth of facial and body hair.  \\n \\n8.1.2. \\nAndrogens \\nAndrogens are the  group of hormones that mainly affect the growth and \\ndevelopment of the male\\n reproductive system.  In this group of hormones, \\ntestosterone is the most active and dominant androgen. It is mainly secreted \\nin \\nmales by the Leydig cells in their testes, and small amount of them is secreted by \\nthe adrenal glands of both male and female.   \\n \\nApart from testosterone, other androgens are:  \\n1) Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): It is a steroid hormone that is produc ed \\nfrom cholesterol in the adrenal cortex. It is the main precursor of natural \\nestrogens. It is also known as dehydroisoandrosterone or \\ndehydroandrosterone.  \\n2) Androstenedione (Andro): It is an androgenic steroid that is synthesised by \\nthe ovaries, adrenal c ortex, and cortex. Androstenediones form the parent \\nstructure of estrone when gets metabolically converted into testosterone and \\nother androgens.  \\n3) Androstenediol: It is a steroid metabolite \\nthat acts as a controller of \\ngonadotropin secretion.  \\n4) Androsterone: It is a  chemical by-product of androgens or a derivative of \\nprogesterone that produces minor masculinising effects. It is found in almost \\nequal amounts in the plasma and urine of both males and females.  \\n5) Dihydrotestosterone (DHT):  It is a metabolite of t\\nestosterone, and an \\nandrogen with more potency than testosterone as it binds more strongly to \\nandrogen receptors. It is synthesised in the adrenal cortex.  \\nCHAPTER \\n8 \\n \\nPharmacology of Drugs Acting \\non Endorcine System - II \\n', 'link': [{'kind': 2, 'xref': 4053, 'from': Rect(180.89996337890625, 365.29998779296875, 209.8399658203125, 377.95001220703125), 'uri': 'http://www.yourhormones.info/glands/testes.aspx', 'id': ''}]}, 230: {'text': '230 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\n8.1.2.1. \\nClassification \\nAndrogens are classified into two classes: \\n1) Naturally Occurring Androgens\\n: Testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, \\nDehydroepiandrosterone, and Androsterone. \\n2) Synthetic Androgens : Methyltestosterone, Fluoxymesterone, Testosterone \\nundecanoate, and Mesterolone. \\n \\n8.1.2.2. \\nSynthesis \\nThe production of male hormones and sperm is co ntrolled by the pituitary gland \\nand hypothalamus. Luteinising hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone \\n(FSH) are the two essential messenger hormones produced by the pituitary gland \\nwhich act on the testes. LH is required by the Leydig cells in the te\\nstes for \\nproducing testosterone. This  testosterone along with the  FSH acts on the \\nseminiferous tubules (sperm-producing tubes) for producing sperm (figure 8.1). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n8.1.2.3. \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nTestosterone is released by the interstitial (Leydig) cells of the testes through the \\neffect of pulsatile secretion of LH from pituitary. FSH mainly promotes \\nspermatogenesis in tubular (Sertoli) cells.

FEMALE SEX HORMONES \\n \\n8.2.1. \\nIntroduction \\nThe three main types of female sex hormones are: \\n1) Estrogen: It is synthesised by the ovaries, body fat (in small amounts), and  \\nadrenal gland. It is helpful in maintaining calcium in bones, \\nregulating the \\nbalance of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein \\n(LDL) cholesterol in blood, and maintaining memory functions, blood sugar \\nlevels, and emotional balance. \\n2) Progesterone: It is synthesised in huge quantities during and after ovulation. It \\nmakes the uterus suitable for implantation of a fertilised egg. It also reduces \\nbody fat, assists in relaxing and reducing anxiety, and enhances hair growth. \\n \\n3) Testosterone: It is the main sex hormone in males,\\n however is also \\nsynthesised in small amounts in females by the ovaries and adrenal glands. It \\nis essential in health and well -being. It influences mood, libido, energy, and \\nbody fat. It also provides protection against osteoporosis.  \\n \\n8.2.2. \\nEstrogens \\nThe primary female sex hormone\\ns are estrogens  (or oestrogens ) which are \\nresponsible for the development and control of \\nreproductive system  and \\nsecondary sex characteristics in females. Any natural or synthetic substance that \\nmimics the effects of the natural hormone is categorised under oestrogens. The \\nmost poten t and prevalent endogenous estrogen is \\n17β-estradiol (a steroid ) \\nwhile many estradiol metabolites also have the estrogenichormonal activity.  \\n \\nEstrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3) are the examples of three main \\nnaturally occurring estrogens in w omen. Estetrol (E4) is the other type of \\nestrogen that is formed during pregnancy. Small amount of estrogens are also \\nfound in males which perform some critical physiological roles. \\n \\n8.2.2.1. \\nClassification \\nEstrogens are classified as given below: \\n1) Natural Estrogens \\ni) \\nEstradiol (most common type in women of child bearing age), \\nii) Estrone (the only estrogen that the body makes after menopause), and \\niii) Estriol (the main estrogen during pregnancy). \\n2) Synthetic Estrogens \\ni) \\nSteroidal: Ethinylestradiol, Mestranol, and Tibolone. \\nii) Non-Steroidal:Diethylstilbestrol (stilbestrol), Hexestrol, and Dienestrol. \\n \\n8.2.2.2. \\nSynthesis \\nEstrogens are mainly produced by the ovaries in their theca interna cells . They \\nare secreted by the ovarian follicles and also by the corpus luteu m once the egg \\nhas been released from the follicle and from the placenta.

Starting \\non day 5 and ending at day 26 \\nfollowed by break for 7 days. \\n', 'link': []}, 241: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endorcine System - II (Chapter 8)  \\n241 \\n*  \\n* \\nii) Triphasic Formulations: These have three different combinations. At \\ntimes, the progestin levels increases progressively during the cycle, but \\nsome other preparations may also change the quantities of estrogen \\nadministered during the cycle. One formulation maintains the progestin \\ndose constant and at the same time  raises the estrogen content of tablets \\nin in the later stages of cycle.  \\n \\n8.2.4.2. \\nContraception Methods \\nThe types of oral contraceptives formulations are: \\n1) Estrogen-Progestogen Combi\\nnations (Combination Pills): \\nThese \\npreparations are given as a  single daily dose from day 5 to day 25 of the \\nmenstrual cycle (21 days), and calculating the first day of menses as day first. \\nOn completion of the course, bleeding occurs within 3 to 4 days sh\\nowing \\nwithdrawal symptoms. There are 7 pill-free days between the regime, and the \\ncourse is restarted on day 5 of the next cycle. The cycle becomes an \\novulatory with regular cycle bleeding on repeating the schedule. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\ni) Estrogen blocks FSH release through negative feedback action on the \\nanterior pituitary, and thus decreases the development of ovarian follicle.  \\nii) Progestogen inhibits LH release and hence stops ovulation. It is also \\nresponsible for making the cervical mucus less appropriate f\\nor the \\npassage of sperm. \\niii) Estrogen and progestogen work together for altering the endometrium to \\ndepress implantation.  They may also intervene with the synchronised \\ncontractions of cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes which mediate \\nfertilisation and implantation. \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nWeight gain  (due to fluid retention or an anabolic effect or both\\n), m ild \\nnausea, flushing, dizzine ss, depression, irritability, s kin changes, ( e.g., acne \\nand/or an increase in pigmentation), and a menorrhea of variable duration on \\nstopping the pill.  \\n2) Sequential Estrogen-Progestogen Preparations (Sequential Pills): These \\nare cyclical estrogen-progestogen preparations, frequently recommended for \\nwomen taking combined  HRT, having  menopausal symptoms but normal \\nperiods. Two types of cyclical HRT are: \\ni) Monthly HRT is recommended for women having regular periods. \\nii) Three-Monthly HRT is recommended for women having irregular periods.\\n \\n3) Continuous Low-Dosage Progestogen Preparations (Minipills): These are \\noral contraceptives containing progestin hormone only and are also known as \\nthe progestin-only birth control pill s. The minipill s do not have estrogen, \\nbut contain lower progestin dose than in a combination oral contracept\\nive \\npill. They act by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus and thinning the \\nuterus lining (endometrium), thus inhibiting the sperm from reaching the egg.  \\n \\nSometimes, they also suppress  ovulation. They should be taken at the same \\ntime every day for maximum effectiveness. \\n', 'link': [{'kind': 2, 'xref': 3445, 'from': Rect(48.14997100830078, 489.8599853515625, 85.03196716308594, 502.510009765625), 'uri': 'http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Periods/Pages/Introduction.aspx', 'id': ''}]}, 242: {'text': '242 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\n4) Post-Coital (Emergency) Contraception:\\n \\nOral administration of \\nlevonorgestrel, either alone or in combination with estrogen, is efficient if \\nadministered within 72 hours of unprotected i ntercourse and repeated after \\n12 hours .

DRUGS ACTING ON THE UTERUS \\n \\n8.3.1. \\nIntroduction \\nUterus is an organ of immense importance in the reproductive phase of mammals, \\nand can go through many significant changes. For example, before pregnancy the \\norgan weighs nearly 50gm, while during the gestation period it weighs up to \\n 1000gm. During this duration, its capability may vary from 5ml to 5 litres. \\nDrugs acting on uterus can influence the endometrium or the myome\\ntrium. The most \\nessential drugs influencing the endometrium are estrogens, progestins and their \\nantagonists. Myometrium has both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation and \\nautonomic drugs can disturb its mobility. But, the directly acting drugs are more \\nessential and have more specific action s. The sensitivity of myometrium towards \\ndrugs is noticeably affected by the hormonal and gestational status. \\n \\n \\n8.3.2. \\nClassification \\nDrugs acting on uterus are classified as follows: \\n1) Uterine Stimulants (or Oxytocics or  Abortifacients): Oxytocin, Ergot \\nalkaloids (ergometrine), and Prostaglandins. \\n2) Uterine Relaxants (or Tocolytics ): Adrenergic agonists, calcium channel \\nblockers, magnesium sulphate, oxytocin antagonist, and Ritodrine. \\n', 'link': []}, 245: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endorcine System - II (Chapter 8)  \\n245 \\n*  \\n* \\n8.3.3. \\nUterine Stimulants (Oxytocics, Abortifacients) \\nUterine stimulants are medications which are administered for causing \\ncontractions in the uterus, or for increasing the frequency and intensity of the \\ncontractions.  \\n \\nThey are used for: \\n1) Inducing (starting) or augmenting (speeding) labour, \\n2) Facilitating uterine contractions after a miscarriage, \\n3) Inducing abortion, or \\n4) Reducing haemorrhage after childbirth or abortion.  \\n \\nThe following drugs increase uterine motility, especially at term: \\n1) Posterior Pituitary Hormone: Oxytocin and Demoxytocin. \\n2) Ergot Alkaloids: Ergometrine (Ergonovine) and Methylergometrine. \\n3) Prostaglandins: PGE2, PGF2\\uf061, 15-methyl PGF2\\uf061, and Misoprostol. \\n4) Miscellaneous: Ethacridine and Quinine. \\n \\n8.3.3.1. \\nOxytocin \\nSynthetically produced oxytocin is pure and is not contaminated with vasopressin \\nlike the out-dated natural oxytocin. Oxytocin is used intravenously for inducing \\nlabour, for uterine inertia, haemorrhage , or while abortion. It produces rhythmic \\ncontractions instantaneously, with relaxation between, i.e., it imitates the normal \\nuterine activity. \\n \\nSevere water intoxication can occur with continuous intravenous infusions of \\noxytocin, particularly when given with huge volumes of fluid. The relation of \\noxytocin with neonatal jaundice seems  to be because of increased erythrocyte \\nfragility that causes haemolysis. \\n \\nChemical Nature  \\nOxytocin is a non-peptide hormone synthesised by the paraventricular cells of \\nhypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary. It is a \\ncyclic disulphide, \\nwhich contains one molar equivalent of each of 8 amino acids [figure 8.5(a)] and \\nthree equivalents of ammonia. The amino acids cysteine, tyrosine, isoleucine, \\nglutamic acid, and aspartic acid are organised in a loop, and the others like \\nproline, leucine and glycine are arranged in a side chain. Oxytocin is structurally \\nsimilar to vasopressin [figure 8.5(b)] and also contains antidiuretic activity. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 8.5: Chemical Structures of (a) Oxytocin; (b) Arginine \\nVasopressin (ADH).

It is packaged in a \\nsecretory granule as part of \\nneurophysin I (a larger protein ). The granule is \\nconveyed down the nerve axon by the median eminence of hypothalamus and ends at \\nthe capillaries which supply the posterior pituitary gland. Oxytocin is separated from \\nneurophysin I for releasing the biologically active oxytocin into the circulation.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nRegulation of Secretion \\n1) Secretion of oxytocin at the time of child birth is induced by: \\ni) Stretching of the cervix and vagina, and  \\nii) Decline in progesterone level at birth.  \\n2) Suckling Reflex (figure 8.6): Secretion of oxytocin \\nfrom the maternal \\npituitary is induced by:  \\ni) The sound of baby crying, and  \\nii) The baby‟s lips on the nipple and sucking.  \\n3) Production of oxytocin is blocked by acute stress, \\nand catecholamine \\n(epinephrine) that inhibits oxytocin secretion from oxytocin neurone. \\n4) Production of oxytocin receptor in the uterus increases during late gestation \\nbecause of increased estrogen secretion. \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nOxytocin acts via G-protein coupled receptors by activating inositol and calcium \\n(second messengers) for assisting in contraction of the uterine smooth muscle s. \\nOxytocin also increases the secretion of PGF 2α and PGE2, and leukotrienes that \\nact synergistically for stimulating the uterine smooth muscles.  \\nSpinal \\ncord     \\nPosterior pituitary  \\nHypothalamus \\nSupraoptic \\nnucleus \\nParaventricular \\nnucleus \\nMilk ejection  \\nOxytocin    \\nFigure 8.6: Biosynthesis and Regulation of Secretion of Oxytocin \\nUterine \\ncontraction   \\nOxytocin  \\nSuckling     \\nBlood vessel  \\nReflex arc \\n', 'link': []}, 247: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endorcine System - II (Chapter 8)  \\n247 \\n*  \\n* \\nOxytocin stimulates the frequency as well as  the strength of the contractile \\nactivity in the uterine smooth muscle s. The autonomic innervation of the uterus \\ndoes not facilitate the constr icting effects of the drug. It ha s a direct action on \\nuterus, and shows more intense effect on the fundus of uterus than on the cervix. \\nContraction is the form of uterine response that is followed by relaxation of the \\nuterine smooth muscle\\ns. Durin g the last 9\\n weeks of pregnancy, \\nthe \\nresponsiveness of uterus to oxytocin increases 8 times, and 30 times increase in \\noxytocin receptor density is seen amid early pregnancy and early labour. High \\ndoses of externally administered oxytocin preparations result in sustained uterine \\ncontractions which may even rupture the uterus.  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics \\n1) Absorption: Intramuscular administration of oxytocin facilitates  uterine \\ncontractions within 3-5 minutes, and \\nlasts for  2-3 hours. \\nIntravenous \\nadministration of oxytocin facilita tes uterine contr actions within a minute, \\nand lasts for an  hour. Sometimes oxytocin is given as nasal dosage forms as \\nit gets quickly absorbed through nasal membranes.  \\n2) Distribution: Oxytocin gets widely distributed in the extracellular fluid, and \\nsmall amounts of it reach the foetal circulation. \\n3) Metabolism: Oxytocin gets rapidly metabolised by the liver and kidneys. \\n4) Excretion: Oxytocin gets excreted in urine. \\n5) Half-Life: Oxytocin has a half-life of 3-9 minutes. \\n \\nPhysiological Actions \\n1) Uterus: The motor activity of human uterus is low for the course of first and \\nsecond trimesters of pregnancy . But, spontaneous motor activity increases \\ngradually in the third trimester of pregnancy and lasts up to the beginning of \\nlabour. Oxytocin increases the frequency and for ce of uterine contractions. \\nThe autonomic innervation of the uterus does not facilitate the constricting \\neffects of the drug. It has a direct action on myometrium, and shows more \\nintense effect on the fundus of uterus than on the cervix.  \\n2) Breast: Induction of milk ejection is one of the unique actions of oxytocin. \\nMilk ejection is induced by the suckling of breast by the child, and is \\nmediated by the \\nconstriction of myoepithelium  surrounding the alveolar \\nchannels in the mammary gland. This action \\nforces the milk from the \\nalveolar channels into the large collecting ducts, which is accessible by the \\nsuckling child. Oxytocin only induces  milk flow ; it  does not increase the \\namount of milk. After parturition, the synergistic \\neffects of prolactin and \\noxytocin mediate sufficient milk production and ejection, both of which are \\nprovoked by the breast suckling by the infant.  \\n3) Heart: Oxytocin causes vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle s. \\nThus, it can cause hypotension and reflex tachycardia.  \\n4) Blood Vessels: Intravenous administration of oxytocin causes vasodilation and \\ndecreases blood pressure. But, the umbilical blood vessels are constricted.  \\n5) Kidney: Oxytocin causes retention of water due to weak vasopressin-like effects. \\n', 'link': []}, 248: {'text': '248 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\nUses \\n1) Induction of Labour: Oxytocin is used for inducing labour in those women \\nwho would be more susceptible to risk if their pregnancy is continued and \\ndelivery is postponed, as this may result in foetal and maternal morbidity and \\nmortality. Syntocinon (a synthetic oxytocin ) is used for ind ucing labour, \\nspecifically in uterine inertia. \\n2) Augmentation of Labour: Oxytocin can be used in uterine inertia when the \\nnormal first stage \\nof labour is extended with the stoppage of cervical \\ndilatation and descent. \\n3) Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH): Oxytocin is  specifically used for this \\ncondition when effect of ergometrine is insufficient. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\n1) Cardiovascular Effects : Tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, \\nand hypotension in mother and neonate. \\n2) EENT (Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat): Neonatal retinal haemorrhage. \\n3) Gastrointestinal Effects: Nausea and vomiting in mother and neonate. \\n4) Miscellaneous Effects: Prolonged intravenous infusion of oxytocin causes \\nsevere water intoxication with seizures, coma, and even death. \\n5) Obstetrics and Gynecology: Postpartum haemorrhage in the mother. \\n \\nInteractions and Contraindications \\nThe effects of oxytocin are augmented by dinoprostone and misoprostol. \\nOxytocin is contraindicated in cases of hypersensitivities and expectation of non-\\nvaginal delivery. \\n \\nOxytocin Abnormalities \\nCurrently, the consequences of large doses of oxytocin are not clear. High levels of \\noxytocin may cause benign prostatic hyperplasia . The affected males may have \\nproblems in passing urine. This condition can be treated  by controlling oxytocin \\n levels, but more research is required before any probable treatment is available.    \\nLikewise, presently it is also not completely understood i f low oxytocin levels \\nhave any consequences. The lack of oxytocin  in a nursing mother can stop the \\nmilk ejection ref lex and inhibit breastfeeding. Low oxytocin levels may cause \\nautism and autistic spectrum disorders (\\ne.g., Asperger syndrome ). Some \\nscientists are certain that \\nthese disorders can be treated with \\noxytocin. Low \\noxytocin is also related to depressive symptom\\ns and it has been suggested for \\ntreating depressive disorders. But, there is insufficient proof as of now to back its \\nuse in any such conditions.   \\n \\n8.3.3.2. \\nErgometrine \\nErgot ( Claviceps purpurea) is a fungus which g rows on rye and comprises of \\nvarious pharmacologically active substances (ergometrine). Ergot poisoning was \\nonce very usual and was related to abortion. Ergometrine (or ergonovine) was \\nderived from ergot in 1935 and was accepted as an oxytocic principle.    \\n', 'link': []}, 249: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endorcine System - II (Chapter 8)  \\n249 \\n*  \\n* \\nErgometrine is used for causing uterine contractions for treating heavy vaginal \\nbleeding post-childbirth. It can be administered orally, or through intramuscular \\nor intravenous route. When taken orally it s onset of action is 15 minutes, and is \\nfaster when injected. Its duration of action is 45-180 minutes.  \\n \\nSynthesis \\nThe structurally simpler clavines\\n, i.e., agroclavine is used \\nfor obtaining the \\nlysergic acid moiety of the ergot alkaloids of amide -type. The figure 8.7 depicts \\nthe biosynthesis of ergometrine: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMechanism of Action \\nErgometrine stimulates three varieties of receptors that are found in the uterus and \\nin the blood vessel walls. These receptors on stimulation, results in constriction of \\nblood vessels and contraction of uterus. These contractions assist in pushing out the \\nplacenta. These actions decrease the blood flow to uterus and assists in decreasing \\nthe blood loss when the placenta separates from the uterus wall. \\n \\nPhysiological Actions \\nBoth ergometrine and dihydroergometrine are u sed clinically. The latter has a \\nspecific and quite stronger effect on the uterus: \\n1) Uterus: Ergometrine enhances myometrial contractions, which involves  the \\nfundus, body and cervical segments of the uterus.  The contractions incline to \\nbe sustained along with minor relaxation in between contractions.  At high \\ndoses, tonic contractions occur without any interfering relaxation. Uterine \\nblood vessels incline to get constricted because of muscle contracture. The \\nsensitivity of uterus towards ergometrine is high at term. \\n2) Blood Vessels: Ergometrine has moderate vasoconstriction activity, and at \\nhigher doses it may cause hypertension.  \\nFigure 8.7: Synthesis of Ergometrine \\n', 'link': []}, 250: {'text': '250 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\n3) CNS: No effects have been found at normal doses. But, high doses \\nof \\nergometrine cause partial agonistic/antagonistic interaction with serotonergic, \\nadrenergic, and dopaminergic receptors in the brain. \\n 4) GIT: At high doses, ergometrine can increase peristalsis.  \\nUses \\nErgometrine is used for controlling extreme bleeding after childbirth by assisting \\nthe uterus to contract back and controlling blood loss. Injections of ergometrine \\nare used for actively man aging the third stage of labour  that lasts from just after \\nthe delivery of baby till the delivery of placenta. Weak uterine contractions assist \\nin clearing the uterus walls that aids in delivering the placenta. Ergometrine may \\nbe injected into the thigh muscles \\njust after the baby is born for inducing\\n \\ncontractions that accelerate the delivery of placenta and decrease the risk of \\naccompanied heavy bleeding. Ergometrine is given along with oxyt\\nocin to \\nmanage the third stage of labour and for helping the uterus to contract. \\n \\nAdverse Effects \\nErgometrine causes headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest \\npain, arrhythmias or bradycardia (irregular or slow heart rate), shortness of \\nbreath, n arrowing of blood vessels in the \\nbody extremities (vasoconstriction), \\nincrease in blood pressure, skin rashes, heart attack (very rare), and palpitation. \\n \\n8.3.3.3. \\nProstaglandins \\nProstaglandins are not released b y any glands to be transported through blood \\nand act on particular body zones. But, they are produced by a chemical reaction \\nat the required locations in almost all the \\nbody organs. Prostaglandins are \\n involved in the process through which the body controls injury and illness.   \\nEndometrium \\nand \\nmyometrium \\nhave high prostaglandin\\n-synthesising \\n capability, especially in the second proliferative phase of menstrual cycle. \\nPGF2\\uf061 is produced in huge quantities and has been associated to the ischemic \\nnecrosis of e ndometrium that occurs before menstruation. Uterus also produces \\n vasodilator prostaglandins, such as PGE2 and PGI2 (prostacyclin).  \\nApart from their vasoactive properties, the E - and F-prostaglandins also contract \\nthe uterus of \\nboth non -pregnant and pregn ant women . During the gestation \\n period, the uterine muscles are more sensitive to prostaglandins. \\nSynthesis \\nProstaglandins are available in many tissues and organs , and are synthesised by \\nnearly all the nucleated cells. They are autocrine and paracrine li pid mediators, \\nwhich act on platelets, mast cells, and uterine cells. They are synthesised in the \\n cells by Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs). \\nAn intermediate arachidonic acid is produced from diacylglycerol by using \\nphospholipase-A2, and then carried either to  the cyclooxygenase pathway or the \\nlipoxygenase pathway. In the  former pathway, prostacyclin, thromboxane, and \\nprostaglandin D, E and F are produced; while the latter pathway, which is active \\nin leukocytes and macrophages, produces leukotrienes. \\n', 'link': []}, 251: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endorcine System - II (Chapter 8)  \\n251 \\n*  \\n* \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTerminal prostaglandin synthases are liable for the production of other \\nprostaglandins. For example, lipocalin and hematopoetic prostaglandin D synthases \\n(1PGDS and hPGDS) are useful for the production of PGD2 from PGH2. Likewise, \\nPGH2 is convert ed to PGI2 by \\nprostacyclin synthase (PGIS). A thromboxane \\nsynthase (TxAS) is also been recognised. The reactions producing 9α,11β-PGF2α,β \\nfrom PGD2 and PGF2α from PGH2 are catalysed by the prostaglandin-F synthase \\n(PGFS) in the presence of NADPH. Lately, the PGFS enzyme has been crystallised \\nin a complex along with PGD2 and bimatoprost (\\na synthetic analogue of PGF2α). \\n \\nRegulation of Secretion \\nThe chemical reaction s involved in the production of  prostaglandins. The first \\nstep is catalysed by cyclooxygenase (cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase -2) \\nenzyme. Standard levels of prostaglandins are \\nproduced by the action of \\ncyclooxygenase-1 during normal body functions\\n. During an injury (or \\ninflammation in any body part), activation of cyclooxygenase-2 generates extra \\n prostaglandins which assist the body to respond to the injury.  \\nProstaglandins act on particular receptors to produce their actions. Nearly, eight types \\nof prostaglandin receptors have been found to be present in various body organs. \\n These receptors are responsible for the specific actions of every prostaglandin. \\nProstaglandins are short-lived and are rapidly broken down by the body. They \\nexert their actions in the closest areas near their production site. This allows in \\n controlling and restricting their actions. \\nMechanism of Action \\n1) Prostaglandins mainly act  by enhancing uveoscleral aqueous outf\\nlow, \\nhowever other mechanisms like increasing trabecular outflow facility have \\nalso been identified. \\n2) Their intraocular pressure  depressing effect is greater than others\\n, but at \\ntimes is equivalent to β-blockers.  \\nFigure 8.8: Synthesis of Prostaglandins \\n', 'link': []}, 252: {'text': '252 \\nPharmacology  \\n*  \\n* \\n3) Nowadays, a prostaglandin derivative (and not a β-blocker) is chosen as a first-\\nline drug for glaucoma because the latter can cause systemic side effects. \\n4) The duration of action of prostaglandins can lengthen up to days if used at \\nbed time.  \\n \\nPhysiological Actions \\n1) Prostaglandins produce pain, activates inflammatory response, and \\ncause \\nfever. When an injury occurs in a tissue , the WBCs reach the site and reduce \\ntissue damage. This results in the synthesis of prostaglandins.  \\n2) An injury in blood v essel causes blood clotting. Thromboxane (a type of \\nprostaglandin) stimulates platelet contraction and clotting. On the other hand, \\nPGI2 is synthesised for \\nexerting opposite effects on the walls of blood \\nvessels where clots should not be formed.   \\n3) PGE2 induces labour and other reproductive processes by stimulating uterine \\ncontractions. \\n4) Prostaglandins also act on many other organs like kidneys for surging blood \\nflow, gastrointestinal tract for \\npreventing acid synthesis and increasing\\n \\nprotective mucus secreti on), and leukotrienes for increasing contraction of \\nbronchi related to asthma. \\n \\nUses \\nPGE2 and PFG 2α are strong oxytocics, therefore, they are used for medically \\nterminating pregnancy, for emptying the uterus after missed abortio\\nn, and for \\ntreating benign hydatidiform mole. These prostaglandins make the cervix soft by \\nraising the proteoglycan content in\\n the cervical mucosa. \\nCarboprost \\ntromethamine (PGF2α), dinoprostone (PGE2), and misoprostol (PGE 1 derivative) \\nare the three prostaglandins used for terminating pregnancy in the midterm. \\n \\nAbnormalities \\nAs a response to an injury or infection  that causes inf lammation, redness, pain, \\nand fever,  high levels of prostaglandins  are synthesised to aid in the normal \\nhealing p rocess of the body.  But, this natural res ponse may result in excessive \\nproduction of prostaglandins that causes undesirable inflammation and re lated \\ndiseases. This means that drugs blocking cyclooxygenase-2 can be used for treating \\nconditions like heavy menstrual bleeding, painful menstrual cramps, arthritis, and \\n colonic and breast cancer.  \\nSynthetic prostaglandins may be used for increasing pro staglandin levels in the \\nbody during various conditions. These conditions may include \\nabortion or \\nunwanted pregnancy during which prostaglandins are administered for inducing \\nlabour. They may also be used for treating glaucoma, stomach ulcers, and \\ncongenital heart disease in neonates. \\n \\n8.3.4. \\nUterine Relaxants (Tocolytics) \\nUterine relaxants  (or anti-contraction medications ) are used for suppressing \\npremature labour. They are administered when delivery \\nmay lead to premature \\nbirth. The trea\\ntment also \\nincludes administration of\\n betamethasone ( a \\nglucocorticoid) that significantly increases fatal lung maturity in 1-2 days.  \\n', 'link': []}, 253: {'text': 'Pharmacology of Drugs Acting on Endorcine System - II (Chapter 8)  \\n253 \\n*  \\n* \\nUterine relaxants are used for reducing uterine motility. They are used for delaying \\nlabour, stopping vulnerable abortion, and in dysmenorrhoea. Suppression of labour is \\nrequired to let the foetus grow, to initiate glucocorticoid treatment for maturation of \\nfoetal lung, or to transfer the mother in labour to a proper hospital; however, no \\nproper \\ndrug is present till now. An effort for delaying premature labour may be successful if \\ncervical dilatation is <4cm and „taking up‟ of lower segment is negligible. Uterine \\nrelaxants should not be used if antepartum haemorrhage is occurring, me mbranes \\n have ruptured, serious toxaemia of pregnancy, intrauterine infection, or foetal death.  \\nSome commonly used tocolytics are: \\n1) Adrenergic agonists, \\n2) Calcium channel blockers, \\n3) Magnesium sulphate,  \\n4) Oxytocin antagonist, and \\n5) Miscellaneous drugs. \\n \\n8.3.4.1. \\nAdrenergic Agonists \\nPremature labour is suppressed and delivery is delayed during emergency cases or \\nacute foetal distress by using \\nritodrine (a β2-selective agonist having uterine \\nrelaxant action). For steady action the initial dose is 50µg/min i.v. infusion, which \\nis increased after every 10 minutes till uterine contraction stops or maternal heart \\nrate increases to 120/min.  Contractions are cont inuously suppressed through \\nintravenous infusion or by 10mg 4 -6 hourly intramuscular injection followed by \\n10mg 4-6 hourly oral administration. Delivery is delayed by few hours to a few \\nweeks in around 70% cases. Ritodrine results in increased maternal morbidity. The \\nnew born may develop hypoglycaemia and ileus. Its use should be restricted in \\n mothers having diabetes, heart disease, or taking steroids or β-blockers. \\nIsoxsuprine is used orally or intramuscularly for stopping susceptible abortions, \\n but its efficiency is unclear.  \\nMechanism of Action: Ritodrine is a β2-receptor agonist which acts on the \\nsmooth muscle cell s and increase cAMP levels in the presence of adenylate \\ncyclase enzyme. The increased levels of cAMP reduce the concentration of free \\n calcium ions and also contractions.  \\nAdverse Effects: Hypotension, arrhythmia, pulmonary oedema, tachycardia, hyper-\\ninsulinaemia, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, anxiety, headache, and restlessness.\\n \\n \\n8.3.4.2. \\nCalcium Channel Blockers \\nCalcium channel blockers\\n decrease the \\ntone of myometrium and prevent \\ncontractions because the entry o f Ca2+ ions is important for uterine contractions. \\nIf used early, nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) delays labour effectively  as \\nit has a  smooth muscle relaxant action. 10mg nifedipine \\nafter every 20-30 \\nminutes is used orally until uterine contractions diminish, and 10mg nifedipine 6 \\nhourly is \\ngiven afterwards. Tachycardia and hypotension \\noccur at doses \\nsuppressing uterine contractions.  Decreased placental perfusion causes foetal \\nhypoxia. But, it has been found in a multi\\n-centric trial that nifedipine has less \\nmaternal side effects than ritodrine in pre\\n-term labour.

As per \\nWHO, it is the preferred drug for preventing and treating seizures during pre\\n-\\neclampsia and eclampsia.

Its efficiency is \\nequivalent to β2-agonists, but, a recent review has suggested that it is \\nunsuccessful in inhibiting pre-term birth. Higher infant mortality has been found \\nin one trial after using magnesium sulph ate. It also increases perinatal mortality \\n in low birth-weight off-springs, however it can be harmless at term.  \\nAdverse Effects:  Magnesium sulphate is considered harmful to be used as a \\ntocolytic as it causes CNS and respiratory depression, cardiac arrhy thmias, and \\nmuscular paralysis in the mother and new born baby.  \\n \\n8.3.4.4. \\nOxytocin Antagonist \\nAtosiban (a peptide analogue of oxyt ocin) acts as an antagonist at the oxytocin \\nreceptors. Clinical trials suggest that it decreases premature uterine contractions \\nand delays pre-term delivery with less cardiovascular and metabolic side effects \\nin comparison to  β2-adrenergic agonists. But, its advantages in terms of infant \\nsurvival are unclear, as in one trial high infant dea ths were seen in the group that \\nwas treated with atosiban in contrast to placebo.  \\n \\n8.3.4.5. \\nMiscellaneous Drugs \\nOther drugs suppressing uterine interactions include nitrates, ethyl alcohol, \\nprogesterone, PG synthesis inhibitors , and general anaesthetics.

BIOASSAY \\n \\n9.1.1. \\nIntroduction \\nBioassay (or biological assay  or biologic standardisation ) is the method of \\nestimating the potency of an active principle in a unit amount of formulation or \\ndetection and measurement of a substance’s concentration in a formulation using \\nbiological methods (i.e., observation of clinical effects on living tissue\\ns, \\nmicro/macro or immune cells or animal). Bioassays are procedures for estimating \\nthe nature, constitution, or potency of substance s through the reactio ns that \\naccompany its use in living matter.  \\n \\nBioassay is the method of determining the concentration  or potency of physical, \\nchemical, or biological agents through measurement  of and comparison between \\nthe extents of response of test with the standard \\nin an appropriate biological \\nsystem kept under a standard set of parameters. Bioassays also involve estimating \\nthe potency of materials through observation of their pharmacological effects on \\nliving animals (in vivo) or isolated tissues (in vitro) and comparison of the effects \\nof materials of unknown potency with those of standard.  \\n \\n9.1.2. \\nPrinciples \\nBurn and Dale articulated certain principles for conducting biological assays. \\nThese principles should be followed to derive effective results. \\n \\nPrinciple 1 \\nAll bioassays (toxicity studies, laboratory studies, and clinical trials) should be \\nrelative against a standard drug or formulation. \\nIn this  way, errors due to \\nbiological variation \\nin bioassays  can be reduced\\n, as the new sample is \\nconcurrently compared with standard formulations. \\n \\nStandard Preparations (Reference Standards):  A standard preparation is a \\nrepresentative of the substance \\nbased on which the activity is comparatively \\nmeasured. The se standard preparations are delivered to experts, pharmaceutical \\nindustries, and research laboratories for standardising new batches of productions. \\n \\nThese reference standards are upheld and distributed within India by the Central \\nDrug Research Laboratory, Calcutta, and the Central Research Institute, Kasauli. \\nThey are controlled by  U.S Pharmacopoeial  Authorities in U.S.A , and by the \\nNational Institute of Medical Research, London , in Great Britain . They are also \\nmaintained and distributed to different laboratories by the Expert Committee on \\nBiological Standardisation made by the WHO.  \\nCHAPTER \\n9 \\n \\n \\nBioassay \\n', 'link': []}, 258: {'text': '258 \\nPharmacology \\n*  \\n* \\nA unit is a certain weight of one of these standard preparations which creates a \\n definite effect in terms of the preparation under test.  \\nPrinciple 2 \\nThe standard and the new drug should be quiet indistinguishable from each other. \\nIf so, their dose-response curves will also be similar and parallel, i.e., the potency \\nratio will be constant all along the response levels. But, this statement will stand \\n invalid if the curves are not parallel.  \\nPrinciple 3 \\nThe procedure for comparing the unknown with the standard drug should ideally \\n(not essentially) test the therapeutic properties of the drug. In an ideal situation, an \\nanalgesic should be checked for its analgesic activity, and an anticonvulsant should \\nbe checked for its anticonvulsant activity. But, it is not always achievable, e.g., for \\ninsulin dropping of blood glucose would be the preferable potency index, but the \\nfrequently used method is mouse convulsion method, where the per\\ncentage of \\n mouse developing convulsions is matched with the standard and new insulin. \\nPrinciple 4 \\nThe procedure should assess and allow an approximation of the errors because of \\nbiological diversification in various animals/persons at any given time and in the \\nsame animal/person at different times. The measures undertaken for minimising \\nerrors due to biological variations include: \\n1) The experimental conditions should be kept constant. \\n2) The biological response (indicator) should be sensitive to the drug. \\n3) The biological response (indicator) should be insensitive to other drugs. \\n4) The biological response (indicator) should give constant and reproducible results. \\n5) A standard preparation formulation (of known concentration ) should be \\navailable for comparing the response. \\n6) Large number of experiments and assays should be conducted for minimising \\nbiological variation, and  \\n7) Animals of the same species and st rain (ideally litter mates) , of equal age, \\nweight and gender, consuming equivalent diet and sheltered in same \\nconditions should be used for performing experiments\\n. I n some bioassay \\ndesigns, cross-over of animals getting the sample and standard may occur. \\n \\nBriefly, the sources of error in bioassays are primarily of two types: \\n1) Errors due to biological variation, and \\n2) Errors due to faulty methodology.     \\n \\n9.1.3. \\nApplications \\nFollowing are the applications of bioassay methods: \\n1) They are used for the standardisation of drugs of natural origin. \\n2) They are used for determining the\\n biologically active substances (such as \\nnoradrenaline, adrenaline, acetylc holine, and serotonin ) in body fluids or \\ntissue extracts.     \\n3) They are used for the s\\nelection of new compounds for determining their \\nbiological activity. Synthetic products are also bioassayed because their \\nchemical structure does not correctly interpret pharmacological activity. \\n', 'link': []}, 259: {'text': 'Bioassay (Chapter 9)  \\n259 \\n*  \\n* \\n4) They are  performed if the \\ndrug consists of a mixture of substances of \\ndifferent structure and activity, e.g., posterior pituitary, digitalis.  \\n5) They are used for diagnostic\\n and research purposes; for example , the \\nconcentrations of gonadotropins in blood or urine is determined by injecting \\nthese fluids in. \\n6) They are used for determining the d ose of a drug required for generating a \\ntherapeutic or toxic response, e.g., LD50 (lethal dose 50) or ED 50 (effective \\ndose 50). \\n \\nThe result of bio assay is upheld when the results of biological and chemical \\nprocedures for the assay of an active substance vary.  \\n \\nIndications for Bioassay \\n1) When the chemical constituents are unknown but the substance has a \\nparticular biological action, e.g., Long Acting Thyroid Stimulator (LATS). \\n2) When the chemical assay procedure is too complicated or unresponsive, e.g., \\nadrenaline and histamine may also be bioassayed in microgram amounts. \\n3) When drugs have different composition but similar pharmacological action, \\ne.g., digitalis glycosides derived from multiple sources. \\n4) When the active principles are not known, they cannot be obtained easily, \\ne.g., peptide hormones.  \\n \\nResponsiveness and specificity are responsible for the essentiality of bioassay in \\npharmacology. It is an economic and considerable approach for determining the \\navailability of several endogenous compounds of pharmacological, physiological, \\nand toxicological importance , like hypothalamic factors, serotonin, encephalins, \\nEDRF, and prostaglandins. \\n \\n9.1.4. \\nTypes of Bioassay \\nThere are three major types of bioassays (apart from qualitative assays): \\n1) Indirect Assay: In this bioassay type , the relationship of dose with the  \\nresponse of each drug is firstly determined. Then the dose conforming to a \\nparticular response is derived from the relation for each drug individually. \\n2) Direct Assay: \\nIn this bioassay type, the d\\noses of standard and test \\npreparations are satisfactory for generating a particular response and can be \\ndetermined directly. \\n3) Quantal Assay: In this bioassay type, the response occurs as “all or none” \\nmeaning no response or extreme response. End point method is used for their \\nbioassay. Threshold effect produces a predetermined response that is measured.\\n \\n \\nionof Standard\\nConcentrat\\nof theTest\\nDose\\n= Dose of the Standard\\nion of Unknown \\nConcentrat\\n\\uf0b4\\n \\n \\nVarious other types of bioassays are as follows: \\n1) Graded Assay: It is proportionate to the drug dose and the drug response ranges \\nfrom no response to extreme response. Graded response can be any type of \\nmeasured responses in isolated tissues (mostly) and also in whole animals. These \\nresponses are extensively graded and are available in abundance. For example, \\nblood pressure, blood sugar concentrations, contractions of muscle\\n, etc.  \\n', 'link': []}, 260: {'text': '260 \\nPharmacology \\n*  \\n* \\n2) Matching Method: This bioassay procedure involves the test substance and \\nstandard substance, a nd responses produced are compared wit h a trial and \\nerror procedure till they generate equivalent effects. \\n \\nThis may also be restricted to analytical dilution assay\\n because the assay \\nincludes the measurement of the factor by which the test substance is diluted or \\nconcentrated for producing a response which is equivalent to that of a known \\nquantity of the standard drug. The benefit of this method is its non-dependency \\non the assumption of a dose-response relationship. The major shortcomings of \\nthis method are that it is completely theoretical and experimental errors cannot \\nbe determined. Qualitative differences occurs because it does not provide any \\nsign or similarity in the dose -response curves of the standard drug and test \\nsubstance, and the effects are compared only at the dose level.  \\n \\nAdvantages  \\nIt is a fast, easy, and useful method when there are multiple samples for \\n testing and a semi-qualitative answer is adequate. \\nDisadvantages \\nThis method does not provide  accuracy, and drug -response data (especially \\nno data related to slope). The data is not statistically analysed and may not be \\ncompletely analysed. \\n3) Bracketing Method: This bioassay is carried out through selection of two \\nstandard doses , which would provide a close bracket on both sides of the \\nresponse produced by the unknown . The working dose of the standard is \\nfirstly calculated in the sensitive part of the dose-response curve, i.e., a dose \\nthat will produce almost 50% of the maximum concentration. The standard \\ndrug dose is maintained throughout the  experiment for getting an indication \\nabout the change in the responsiveness of tissue with time. \\n \\nThe standard drug is added at fixed intervals, but discontinuous with the test \\nso that every response generated by a dose of test substance is bracketed by \\nresponses produced by the standard dose. The response of test substance is \\nbracketed in the middle of two responses of the standard. More precise \\nresults are obtained through close bracketing. \\n4) Interpolation Method: This bioassay is the easiest graded response method, \\nand does not need any statistical data or many calculations. Firstly, the drug-\\nresponse curve is obtained from varying doses of standard ACh solution , and \\n then concentration of unknown is read from the standard graph.  \\nInterpolation bioassay me thod takes less time and is still impeccable in \\ncontrast to matching type of bioassay. One of the main benefits of this assay \\nis that the responsiveness of tissue is first determined by the previous plotting \\nof a dose\\n-response curve with a known agonist li\\nke in the case of \\nacetylcholine. If a curve has good linearity, then very precise estimation of \\nthe test substance can be done. \\n5) Three Point Bioassay: In this bioassay method, the Drug-Response Curve \\n(DRC) of a standard and test samples is obtained from the responses because \\nof graded doses. Two standard doses are chosen from the DRC of standard in \\n', 'link': []}, 261: {'text': 'Bioassay (Chapter 9)  \\n261 \\n*  \\n* \\na way that they \\ngenerate 25% to 50% of the maximum response\\n, \\nrespectively. These responses are designated as S1 and S2. The responses of \\nthese doses are shown by the sharpest and the linear part of the curve. One \\ntest from the DRC of \\ntest sample is selected in a way that it provides \\na \\nresponse between the two standard responses, i.e., greater response \\nthan S1 \\nand a smaller response than S2 and is designated as T. \\n \\nPrior to the bioassay, the stand ard and test doses are selected  by recording \\nthe standard and test responses in a randomised manner as per Latin square \\ndesign. The addition pattern of doses is S1, S2, T; S2, T, S1, and T, S1, S2 in \\n3 sequential cycles. The average values of height of contraction for all 3 \\ndoses are calculated and are brought in use for plotting graph to evaluate the \\ntest sample potency. The accuracy and consistency of three point bioassay  \\nmethod is better than that of matching and bracketin g methods, and the \\nresponsiveness of the isolated tissue formulation is evaluated before testing \\nthe unknown sample.  \\n \\nAdvantages \\nIt is a quick method  and more accurate than the matching bioassay. Certain \\nstatistical methods can be used, but not with much reliability. \\n \\nDisadvantages \\nThis method does not provide accuracy and inherently locks precision. \\n6) Four Point Bioassay: This typical 2×2 parallel bioassay method is sufficient \\nfor measuring parallelism in which drugs acting by the same mechanism are \\nanticipated to create parallel DRCs.  \\n7) Seed Bioassay: Seeds are living organisms, which can be damaged by using \\nchemicals. The seed bioassay method is meant as significant and lab scale \\nmethod for evaluating the toxicity of any substance on commercial crops.  \\n \\nThe seed germination and seed growth \\nimprints under the conflicting \\nconcentrations of industrial origin may give an idea about the eradicating or \\ntoxicological impact of industrial emissions on plants. A lab -scale bioassay \\nof distillery emissions was done using some commercially used cereal crops \\nto derive a possible use of distillery emissions in crop irrigation. \\n8) Antimicrobial Assay: For this bioassay method , standard and clinically \\nderived microorganism strains are used. \\nMany human, animal , and plant \\ndiseases are caused by  pathogenic microorganisms. Fungal and bacterial \\ninfections are the main cause of death in higher organisms. Therefore, the \\ndiscovery of penicillin is thought to be one of the best inventions of the world. \\nThe microbial assay for antibiotics is a procedure that involves microorganisms \\nfor determining the antimicrobial potency of the antibiotics present in medicine.  \\n \\nTraditionally, most of the new antibiotics were isolated from natural sources \\nsuch as soil microbes and plants. Many others were synthesised later  to be \\nused clinically . Unluckily, human tussle against pathogenic microbes will \\nstill need more time to be solved because of several reasons. Most essential \\n', 'link': []}, 262: {'text': '262 \\nPharmacology \\n*  \\n* \\nof them includes discovery of new pathogens and the ability of microbes to \\nproduce resistance against antibiotics. Therefore, the discovery and \\ndevelopment of new antimicrobial agents  is still under process. Significant \\nvariety of chemicals available in biological samples has  a huge potential in \\ndiscovering new antimicrobial agents. \\n9) Antifungal Assay: Fungal infections have increased largely during the last \\ndecade and these generally occur as systemic infections or as co\\n-infections \\nwith other diseases like AIDS or cancer, or \\nin immune -compromised \\npatients. There is a significant requirement for discovering new fungi -toxic \\ncompounds, as there are \\nnumerous plant and human fungal diseases; \\nfor \\nexample, hop downy mildew, potato late blight, tobacco blue mould, dutch \\nelm disease, cereal rusts, corn blight, ergot of rye, and grape downy milde w \\nare some of the plant fungal diseases ; while Aspergillosis, Histoplasmosis, \\nathlete’s foot, and co ccidiomycosis are some of the human fungal diseases . \\nThe increase in fungal infections and the\\n increasing amount o\\nf new \\nantifungal agents suggest  a growing demand for quick and precise methods \\nfor selecting antifungal agents and susceptibility testing.  \\n10) Antimitotic Assay:  Any applied stimulus that generates a reliable \\nchange/deviation in the mitotic cycle \\nis known as an antimitotic agent. \\nPrevention of cell d ivision is the extent of antimitotic activity of \\nchemical \\ncompounds. Antimitotic chemical compounds like podophyllotoxin and \\nvinblastine can prevent cell division of fertilised sea urchin eggs and starfish \\noocytes. Generally, the reaction should be reversible with time, removal of \\nstimulus, or addition of an antagonist.  \\n \\n9.1.5. \\nBioassay of Individual Drugs \\nThe bioassays of the following drugs have been discussed below: \\n1) Insulin, \\n2) Oxytocin, \\n3) Vasopressin (ADH, Anti-Diuretic Hormone), \\n4) ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone), \\n5) d-Tubocurarine, \\n6) Digitalis, \\n7) Histamine, and \\n8) 5-HT (Serotonin). \\n \\n9.1.5.1. \\nInsulin \\nStandard Preparation and Unit: Standard insulin is pure, dry, and crystalline. \\nAs stated by the Ministry of Health, Government of India, o\\nne unit consists of \\n0.04032mg of insulin, which is equal to international unit. \\n \\nPreparation of Standard Solution: Accurately weighed 20 units of insulin are \\ndissolved in NaCl solution . The resultant solution is acidified to pH 2.5 using \\nHCl, followed by the addition of  0.5% phenol (for preservation) and 1.4 -1.8% \\nglycerine. The final volume should contain 20units/ml. The solution is stored in a \\ncool place and should be used within 6 months.   \\n', 'link': []}, 263: {'text': 'Bioassay (Chapter 9)  \\n263 \\n*  \\n* \\nPreparation of Test Sample Solution: \\nThe procedure for preparation of test \\nsolution is similar to the procedure for preparation of standard solution. \\n \\nRabbit Method \\nSelection of Rabbits: Healthy rabbits weighing between 1800 -3000gm should \\nbe selected, and a u niform diet should be provided to them.  But, they should be \\nkept fasted for 18 ho urs prior to  assay. Water should be removed during the \\nexperiment.  \\n \\nStandard and Sample Dilutions:  These are freshly prepared during bioassay \\nprocedure through dilu tion with normal NaCl solution such that \\nthey contain  \\n1unit/ml and 2 units/ml, respectively. \\n \\nDose: The dose that may cause adequate reduction in blood sugar level is \\ncalculated for the standard. \\n \\nPrinciple: The test sample potency is evaluated by relating the hypoglycaemic \\neffect of the sample with that of the standard insulin preparation.  \\n \\nExperimental Procedure: Four groups of 3 rabbits each are made. These rabbits \\nare kept in an animal holder with care to prevent excitement. \\n \\nFirst Part of the Test:  Blood sample is taken from the marginal ear vein of each \\nrabbit. An appropriate chemical me thod is used for determining the presence of  \\nreducing sugar per 100ml of blood. This concentration is the initial blood sugar \\nlevel.   Subcutaneous injections of insulin are given to the four groups of rabbits \\nin the following manner: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nA blood sample is taken from each rabbit  for up to 5 hours at an interval of 1 \\nhour each. Blood sugar is es\\ntimated and  this concentration is the  final blood \\nsugar level. \\n \\nSecond Part of the Test (Twin Crossover Test): Same animals are used for the \\nsecond part also. The e xperiment is performed after a week. The  rabbits are \\nfasted and the initial blood sugar level is estimated. The grouping is reversed, i.e., \\nthe animals which received the standard are given the test and those which got \\nless dose of the standard are adminis tered with the higher dose of the test and \\nvice versa. The average percentage reduction in blood sugar of the first and \\nsecond part of the test is determined. \\n \\nMouse Method \\nDistinctive convulsions are shown by the mice after  subcutaneous injections of \\ninsulin at increased temperatures. Comparison is done between the percentage \\nconvulsions produced by the test and standard preparations. \\n12 Rabbits \\nStandard Dilution Standard Dilution \\nTest Sample Dilution Test Sample Dilution \\n', 'link': []}, 264: {'text': '264 \\nPharmacology \\n*  \\n* \\nExperimental Procedure: 100 mice of the same strain and weighing around 18-\\n22gm are selected, provided with a uniform diet, and should be fasted for 18 \\nhours before performing the experiment. \\n \\nStandard and Sample Dilutions: Sterile saline solutions are used for preparing \\nthese solution; they should contain 0.064units/ml (Standard Dilution I) and \\n0.096units/ml (Standard Dilut ion II) of insulin . Test sample solutions are also \\nmade in the same way .  Four groups of 25 mice each are made and insulin is \\nsubcutaneously injected in the following manner: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMice are kept at 33 oC temperature in an air incubator (having a glass fron t and \\nsix shelves), and observed for 90 minutes. The temperature is thermostatically \\nmaintained. Two mice are placed in every box (of perforated metal sheets). \\n \\nThe mice which convulse or die are brought out of the incubator a nd observed. \\nThe reacting mice generally convulse seriously but their failure to turn itself in an \\nupright position after being placed on their back should also be \\nconsidered as \\nconvulsion. The life of c onvulsive mice may be protec ted by injecting 0.5 ml of \\n5% dextrose solution.  Percentage convulsions from both test and standard \\nsamples are compared.  The s urvived animals can again be used in other \\nexperiments after a week.  \\n \\nOther Methods \\n1) Rat Diaphragm Method: This method involves an index of insulin potency, \\nwhich includes the increase in glycogen levels in muscles and increase in \\nglucose levels taken up by the muscles as a response to insulin. \\n \\n2) Rat Epidydimal Method: In this method, the main parameter for measuring \\nthe potency of insulin preparation is its capability to enhance CO2 generation \\nby the fat-pad. \\n3) Radioimmunoassay: In this method, the substance concentration in a unit \\nquantity of preparation is \\ndetermined using radiolabelled antigens. \\nNowadays, several drugs are estimated using  radioimmunoassay methods as \\nthey are highly specific and responsive. \\n \\nThe radioimmunoassay of insulin depends on the capability of human insulin \\n(unlabelled) to replace beef’s insulin (may be labelled) from the binding sites \\n(i.e., antibodies). Following steps are involved in this method: \\ni) Injection of bo vine insulin is given to the sheep. One week later, the \\nserum containing antibodies genera ted against bovine insulin is \\nwithdrawn from the blood of sheep. \\nii) The serum with antibodies is treated with radiolabelled insulin and the \\nratio of bound and free antibodies is estimated. \\n100 Mice \\nStandard Dilution \\n(0.064 units/ml) \\nStandard Dilution \\n(0.096 units/ml) \\nTest Sample \\nDilution  \\nTest Sample \\nDilution  \\n', 'link': []}, 265: {'text': 'Bioassay (Chapter 9)  \\n265 \\n*  \\n* \\niii) Various test tubes labelled as standard and test are added with a mixture \\nof labelled antigen-antibodies.

For every histamine volume, the contact \\ntime is 30 seconds.  \\n \\nAfter every cycle, the tissue is washed twice with the Tyrode’s solution every \\ntime the tissue comes in contact with the solution for 30 seconds [Cycle time \\n= 2.5 minutes, contact time for agonist (30 seconds) + washing twice (30 \\nseconds) + normal record (1 minute)].  \\n5) Various doses of standard histamine solution (0.05ml, 0.1ml, 0.2ml, 0.3ml, \\nand 0.4ml) are added  to select two suitable doses and \\nbracketing the test \\nbetween that range. The quantity of standard that produce s responses similar \\nto those produced by the test is used and effort s are made for reducing the \\nlimits.   \\n6) The doses of standard histamine and the test sample are changed till the test \\ndose was bracketed between 2 doses of \\nstandard histamine that produces \\nalmost similar response to the test.  \\n \\n9.1.5.8. \\n5-HT \\nEach dose of histamine, 5-HT, adrenaline, n oradrenaline, and isoprenaline  are \\nadministered in terms of base, and all others in terms of salt. Krebs solution is \\ngassed with 95% O2 + 5% CO2, whereas all others are gassed with O2. \\n \\nThe Preparation \\n1) Rats are killed by a blow on head, accompanied by slitting of throat. \\n2) The abdomen is dissected, and stomach is removed and dropped in the \\nbathing solution.  \\n', 'link': []}, 274: {'text': '274 \\nPharmacology \\n*  \\n* \\n3) In first experiment, 5 -HT effect on rat stomach was perceived as an \\nincreases in pressure inside the whole iso\\nlated organ kept in the organ \\nbath filled with Krebs solution. \\n4) Fundus is a translucent balloon\\n-shaped tissue that can contain large \\nvolumes. The pyloric antrum is more thick and red, and the two parts are \\ndivided by a certain ridge on the mucosa. \\n5) Since only fundus is observed to be undergoing contraction, the antrum is \\nremoved, except for a band of pyloric tissue wide enough to be fastened \\nonto a cannula. \\n6) The contents of fundus are washed, the cannula is fixed into place and the \\nmuscle is \\nsuspended in a 40m\\nl organ bath maintained at 37\\n°C \\ntemperature. \\n7) The fundus is inflated with 7ml Krebs solution and the internal pressure is \\nrecorded on a kymograph using a water manometer. \\n8) Even though this method is a very less responsive assay method, it can be \\nused to compare the relative sensitivity of fundus with that of the circular \\nor longitudinal muscle. \\n9) The 5-HT dose required for increasing pressure of 1cm of water is found. \\n10) The fundus is then removed from the cannula and sliced into strips, either \\nby slicing spirally  around the same plane as the circular muscle, or by \\nopening the fundus along the lesser curvature and cutting to protect the \\nlongitudinal muscle. \\n11) The strips obtained are suspended in a small bath and the movements are \\nrecorded using an isotonic lever. \\n12) While the circular muscle strips increased the relative sensitivity of the \\nfundus from 6 to \\n18 times, the longitudinal muscle \\nincreased the \\nsensitivity from 40 to 80 times. \\n13) For more experiments, the longitudinal muscle is consequently used. \\n14) A small band of py loric tissue close to the fundus is left uncut to act as a \\nmarker; therefore cutting should be avoided in the wrong way after \\nopening the fundus on a flat plate. \\n15) After fastening cotton at the ends, the strip \\nis slightly stretched and any \\nprotrusions and fringes are removed to provide a long clean thin strip. \\n16) One end of the strip is tied to a tissue holder and dropped into the organ bath. \\n17) The cotton fastened at the other end is linked to the lever.  \\n \\nThe Bath \\n1) The organ bath has an internal diameter of 0.85 cm and length of 15cm up to \\nthe side arm through which the bath fluid is replenished. \\n2) The bath holds 5ml fluid when the tissue holder and bubbling tube are in \\nplace and the gas is bubbling through the solution. \\n3) A fast stream of gas is used for ensuring good stirring. \\n', 'link': []}, 275: {'text': 'Bioassay (Chapter 9)  \\n275 \\n*  \\n* \\n4) The tissue begins to contract if the solution is left unchanged for more than \\n6-8 minutes, as the bath is small and there is a high ratio  of tissue to bathing \\nsolution. \\n5) This is because of build -up of metabolites in the bathing fluid as it \\ncan be \\nsimply reversed by changing the solution. \\n6) To avoid this effect, the bathing solution is perfused through the organ bath at a \\nrate of 1ml/min when the preparation is left untended for more than 5 minutes. \\n7) After the strip has  been isolated, an equivalent slo w perfusion is also used \\ninstantaneously for allowing it to relax for 10-15 minutes. \\n \\nThe Lever \\n1) The lever has a frontal writing point and is made from balsa wood. \\n2) The comparatively high magnification of 16:1 can be used as the tissue has\\n \\nlittle or no impulsive rhythm. \\n3) It is hard to maintain a fixed baseline due to a purely isotonic lever, but this \\ndrawback can be partly solved by having a constant load of 1gm comparative \\nto the tissue attached \\nto a very light spring, so that the restoring force \\nincreases with the muscle contraction. \\n4) A spring of 3cm resting length, extending 3.2cm/gm load, is coupled to the \\nlever at a site twofold the distance of the muscle from the fulcrum. \\n5) The spring is extended to about 5cm, therefore giving an additional resting \\nload of almost 1gm with a small increase in load as the muscle contracts. \\n6) A vibrator is linked to the lever holder for reducing the resistance of the \\nwriting point. \\n \\nResponse to Drugs \\n1) 5-HT or acetylcholine causes slow contractions as they take almost 3 minutes \\nto attain a maximum. \\n2) Almost 90% of the contractions were over in 1½ to 2 min\\nutes so that \\nreproducible effects can be obtained by leaving the drug to interact with the \\ntissues for 90 seconds. \\n3) After administering high doses of 5 -HT (5mg), the relaxation  of muscles is \\nslow but may take up to 6 minutes to return to the former baseline.  \\n \\nThis drawback was removed when it was established that stretching the \\nmuscle to a certain length for 15 -30 seconds after each contraction gives  a \\nsuitable baseline and allows addition of drugs after every 4 minutes. \\n4) The cycle given below is used: \\ni) The drug is added to the bath and the contraction is allowed to increase \\nfor 90 seconds. \\nii) Bath is washed by overflow and a weight is added to the lever so that so \\nthat it instantaneously comes to rest on a bar fixed at a particular level. \\niii) The additional weight is removed after 15\\n-30 seconds \\n(based on \\nindividual muscles). \\niv) The tissue quickly recovered its basal length and the subsequent dose is \\nadded after 2 minutes. \\n', 'link': []}, 276: {'text': '276 \\nPharmacology \\n*  \\n* \\n9.2. SUMMARY \\n \\nThe detail given in the chapter can be summarised as follows: \\n1) Bioassay (or biological assay or biologic standardisation) is the method of \\nestimating the potency of an active principle in a unit amount of formulation \\nor detection and measurement of a substance’s concentration in a formulation \\nusing biological methods (i.e., observation of clinical effects on living \\ntissues, micro/macro or immune cells or animal). \\n2) Burn and Dale \\narticulated certain principles for conducting biological \\nassays. \\n3) Matching Method of  bioassay procedure involves the test substance and \\nstandard substance, and responses produced are compared with a trial and \\nerror procedure till they generate equivalent effects. \\n4) Interpolation Method of  bioassay is the easiest graded response method, \\nand does not need any statistical data or many calculations. Firstly, the drug -\\nresponse curve is obtained from varying doses of standard ACh solution, and \\nthen concentration of unknown is read from the standard graph.  \\n5) Bioassay methods are used for the \\nstandardisation of drugs of natural \\norigin. \\n6) Bioassay methods are used for the \\nselection of new compounds\\n for \\ndetermining their biological activity. \\n7) There are three major types of bioassays (apart from qualitative assays). \\n8) Standard insulin is pure, dry, and crysta lline. As stated by the Ministry of \\nHealth, Government of India, one unit consists of 0.04032mg of insulin, \\nwhich is equal to international unit. \\n9) The vasopressor activity of \\narginine vasopressin  is determined by \\ncomparing the activity of its test preparati\\non with that of its standard \\npreparation under the conditions of an appropriate method of assay.  \\n10) Bioassay of ACTH  is an old assay method. Upon administration, ACTH \\ndecreases the ascorbic acid available in adrenals. This association is used for \\nthe quantitative assay of ACTH. \\n11) Dehydrated alcohol is used for extracting a particular amount of \\ndigitalis \\npowder in a continuous extraction apparatus for 6 hours. \\nThe bioassay of \\nhistamine shows graded dose response and matching assay of histamine in \\nthe ileum of guinea pig. \\n12) Each dose of histamine, 5 -HT, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and isoprenaline \\nare administered in terms of base, and all others in \\nterms of salt. Krebs \\nsolution is gassed with 95% O2 + 5% CO2, whereas all others are gassed with \\nO2. \\n \\n', 'link': []}, 277: {'text': 'Bioassay (Chapter 9)  \\n277 \\n*  \\n* \\n9.3.
