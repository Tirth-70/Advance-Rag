Introduction  \\nCardiovascular system  comprises of the  heart and an extensively branched \\nstructure of blood vessels that transports oxygen, nutrients , heat, and other \\nsubstances throughout the body . \\n \\nCardiac or heart muscles are involuntary striated muscles found in the heart and  \\nits walls, especially in the myocardium (the muscle tissue forming  a thick \\nmiddle layer amid the outer epicardium and the inner endocardium ). For \\ndelivering oxygen and nutr ients , and removing waste products such as carbon \\ndioxide, the cardiac muscle  cells depend on the available blood and e lectrical \\nsupply.  \\n \\nThe myocardial tissue  is made up of contracting cells  and conducting cells . \\nThe pumping action of the heart involves the contracting cells. The \\nconducting tissues of the heart include SA node (acts as the pacemaker), AV \\nnode, and His -Purkinje system. Various parts of the conducting tissue exhibit  \\nautomaticity.  Cardiac muscles  being  specialised tissues have  distinct \\nprope rties  of: \\n1) Excitability:  It is the ability of cardiac cells to depolarise in response to a \\nstimulus.  \\n2) Contractility:  It is the ability of myocardium to contract and pump blood out \\nof the heart.  \\n3) Automaticity : It is the ability of cardiac cells to generate ele ctrical impulses \\nspontaneously.  \\n \\n1.1.2.  Hemodynamics  \\nThe study of the dynamic behaviour of blood  is termed  hemodynamics . \\nPressures are generated in the various parts of heart (cardiovascular pressures) \\nwhen blood flow s from one chamber to another , when valves open and close, and \\nwhen the myocardium contracts and relaxes. Catheters are used to measure and \\nmonitor these pressures by placing their tips in the atria, pulmonary artery , or \\nsystemic arteries; these are  called  the hemodynamic lines . \\n \\nHemodynamic lines  have multiple uses: \\n1) They allow  the sampling of venous and arterial blood without having to stick \\na patient frequently.  \\n2) They help in monitoring different  waveforms , thus  provi ding evidences to \\npatient’s status .

Electrophysiology of Heart  \\nThe cardiac cell is a polarised membrane . It has a  resting membrane potential of \\n–80 to –90mV , and a high Na+ ion concentration outside the membrane and K+ \\nion concentration inside the membrane. Upon excitation, depolarisation occurs as \\nthe cell membrane permeability to Na+ ions increases, the negativity of resting \\npotential is lost,  and a positive current is gen erated inside  the cell. The \\ncharacteristics  of action potential rely on the type of the cell -myocardial \\ncontractile cell , or pacemaker , or potential pacemaker cell. There are five phases  \\nof the action potential of cardiac cells  (figure 1.1 ): \\n1) Phase 0:  In t his phase,  rapid  \\ndepolarisation  of the cell membrane \\nis observed  as the sodium ions \\nrapidly enter the cell through sodium \\nchannels. This phase  is followed by \\nre-polarisation.   \\n2) Phase 1:  In this short and initial \\nphase, rapid  re-polarisation  is \\nobserved as t he potassium ions  move \\nout of the cell . \\n3) Phase 2:  This prolonged plateau \\nphase  is observed as the calcium \\nions enter the cell slowly through the \\ncalcium channels . This phase of \\naction potential is present only in the \\ncardiac cells.  \\n4) Phase 3:  This phase is th e second period of rapid re -polarisation  as the \\npotassium ions move out of the cell.  \\n5) Phase 4:  This is the resting phase  as the resting membrane potential is re -\\nestablished when  the potassium ions return into the cell and sodium and \\ncalcium ions move out of  it.  \\n \\nThe cell s do not depolarise in response to another impulse during the phase s 1 \\nand 2; and  this is called the absolute refractory period . The cells depolarise in \\nresponse to a powerful impulse d uring the phase s 3 and 4 ; and  this is called the \\nrelativ e refractory period . \\n \\nThe heart rate and stroke volume are used for determining the cardiac output. The \\nstroke volume depends on the preload  (which itself depends on venous return) , \\nafterload , and contractility. The load on the heart due to the blood volum e \\nreaching the left ventricle is called preload ; while  the resistance to the left \\nventricular ejection, i.e., the total peripheral resistance  is called afterload . –100 –90 –80 –70 –60 –50 –40 –30 –20 –10 0 +10 +20 \\n4 0 3 ERP 1 \\n2 \\nFigure 1.1: Phases of Cardiac Action Potential.   \\nPhase 0 In dicates Rapid Depola risation, Phases \\n1-3 Indicate Repolarisation, Phase 4 Indicates  \\nGradual  Depolari sation during Diastole.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='18 Pharmacology -II \\n*  * 1.2.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nThe mechanism of action of digitalis can be explained as follows  (figure 1.2): \\n1) Digitalis exerts a positive inotropic effect due to its ability to potentiate  the \\nexcitation -contraction coupling. This is possible since digitalis increases the \\nconcentration of free intracellu lar Ca2+ ions.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2) It inhibits the membrane bound Na+/K+-ATPase transport system (sodium \\npump), resulting in increase of intracellular Na+ ions and loss of intracellular \\nK+ ions.    \\n3) As Na+ ions accumulate  inside the cell, it activates a Na+/Ca2+ carrier system \\n(a non -enzymatic protein carrier) within the membrane. The activation of \\nNa+/Ca2+carrier system results in an increase in the influx of Ca2+ ions.  Three \\nNa+ ions are exchanged for each Ca2+ ion, thereby generating an electrogenic \\npotenti al by this exchanger .  \\n4) Normally, the concentration of Ca2+ ions around the myofilaments is lowered by \\nthe Ca2+ ion pump in the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR). The energy for driving \\nthis pump is obtained by ATP hydrolysis carried out by Na+/K+-ATPase. \\nHowever , digitalis inhibits this enzyme and hence less energy is available for \\ndriving the Ca2+ ion pump. Thus, the supply of Ca2+ ions from SR around the \\nmyofilaments increases, which in turn activates the contractile machinery.  \\n5) The binding of digitalis to sodiu m pump is inhibited by the K+ ions present in \\nthe serum. Hence, conditions of hypokalaemia facilitate the action of \\ndigitalis. On the other hand, conditions of hyperkalaemia can decrea se \\ncardiac toxicity. Arrhythmia  induced by digitalis, is increased by co nditions \\nof hypercalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia.  \\n \\n1.2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics  \\nRoute of administration of digitalis is either oral or intravenous . It is not \\nsuitable for administration by subcutaneous or intramuscular routes as its \\nabsorption from these sites is not re liable and may bring about local irritation, \\ntenderness, swelling, and abscess.

Digitalis is a cumulative drug. It has a prolonged half -life and the \\nduration of its action ranges from days to weeks . The prolonged plasma half -\\nlife of digitoxin is due to its enterohepatic circulation.  \\n \\n1.2.3.3.  Pharmacological Actions  \\nCardiac glycosides have the capability of increasing the myocardial contraction  force , \\nwhich is the most sig nificant property of these drugs. Other than this, they have  \\nseveral extra -cardiac effects on vascular smooth muscle s, kidney s, gut and the CNS:  \\n1) Actions on Heart  \\ni) Administration in small doses  causes an increase in the vagal tone  by \\nsensitisation of barore ceptors and/or activity of the afferent nerves. As a \\nresult, sinus activity decreases which le ads to decrease in conductivity, \\nprolongation of refractory period of the AV node, decre ase in atrial \\nrefractory period, a nd bradycardia.  \\nii) Contractility of the myo cardium increases  by a direct positive \\ninotropic action of digitalis on the heart. Thus, the failing heart contracts \\neven more forcefully, which results in increased cardiac output, complete \\nventricular emptying, and decreased diastolic pressure  and ventri cular \\nsize. Systole lasts for a shorter duration, giving more time for ventricular \\nfilling and rest to the heart.  \\niii) With the increase in  contractility of heart, the oxygen consumption in the \\nmyocardium increases. On the other hand, decrease in the heart rate  and \\nventricular size decreases oxygen requirements of the heart. Hence, the \\ngeneral effect  of digitalis is an improved ventricular performance  of \\nthe failing heart without any significant increase in energy requirement.  \\niv) When administered in comparatively  small therapeutic doses, digitalis \\nimproves the ability of excitation of the myocardium  and the \\nconduction velocity. However, its administration in high doses causes an \\nincreased automaticity and decreases the refractory period of the atria \\nand the ventri cles, resulting in extra -systoles, pulsus bigeminus , and \\nventricular fibrillation.  \\nv) Digitalis slows  the conduction velocity  in the AV node and His -Purkinje \\nsystem, regardless of the dose administered. This is achieved by an \\nincrease in the refractory period  by both vagal as well as the extra -vagal \\nactions of digitalis. Low doses  are characterised by a predominance of \\nvagal effects . As the dose is increased, direct depressant action on the \\nAV node is seen.  \\nvi) Digitalis does not act directly to influence the coro nary  flow. The \\nenhanced  coronary circulation  is a secondary effect of the increased \\ncardiac output and extended diastole.  \\nvii) Changes evident in an ECG  after administration of digitalis includes \\nprolongation of the PR interval  (due to delayed conduction) and \\nshortening of QT interval  (shorter ventricular systole). Other changes \\nare that the ST segment sags below the isoelectric line , and the T -wave \\nappear  smaller, inverted or disappears.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n",

This increases the \\nurinary output and relieves oedema i n patients with cardiac oedema.  \\niii) On Gastrointestinal Tract:  Digitalis stimulates the Chemoreceptor \\nTrigger Zone  (CTZ) in the medulla, thus resulting in nausea and vomiting.  \\niv) On CNS : Digitalis may produce symptoms of visual disturbances  such \\nas blurring of vi sion, photophobia, a dark spot in centre of vision , and \\ndisturbances of coloured vision with yellow and green. In some patients, \\npsychic symptoms and confusion may also be seen.  \\n \\n1.2.3.4.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nCardiac glycosides have the following therapeutic benefits:  \\n1) Patients with congestive heart  failure characterised by a dilated, failing heart \\nwith low  cardiac output (impaired systolic function) are benefited by \\nadministration of digitalis.  \\n2) Treatment of low output cardiac failure with digitalis, in patients where t he \\nmyocardium is not principally damaged, shows the best results. Examples of \\nsuch conditions include atrial fibrillation, valvular defects , and hypertension.  \\n3) The management of cardiac arrhythmias (supraventricular tachyarrhythmias), \\nlike atrial flutter a nd atrial fibrillation, occurring either with or without CCF, \\nemploys the use of digitalis.  \\n \\n1.2.3.5.  Adverse Effects  \\nDigitalis is highly toxic . It has a low margin of safety with a therapeutic index  \\nranging from 1.5 -3. Patients with stead y-state plasma digoxin le vels report a \\nhigher cardiac mortality during maintenance therapy. Nearly 25% of the patients \\nshow either of the toxic symptoms, which include:  \\n1) Extra -Cardiac Effects : These adverse  effects are seen initially  and include \\nanorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdo minal pain. These effects appear due to \\ngastric irritation, mesenteric vasoconstriction, and CTZ stimulation. The \\nother adverse effects include fatigue, absence of a desire to walk or lift an \\narm, malaise, headache, mental confusion, restlessness, hyperpno ea, \\ndisorientation, psychosis, and visual disturbances . Rare adverse effects \\ninclude diarrhoea, skin rashes, and gynaecomastia.  \\n2) Cardiac Effects: Digitalis produces  almost every type of arrhythmia, \\nincluding pulsus bigeminus, nodal and ventricular extrasyst oles, ventricular \\ntachycardia , and terminally fibrillation.  \\n \\n1.2.3.6.

Contraindications  \\nCardiac glycosides are contraindicat ed in the following conditions:  \\n1) Digitalis is contraindicated in hypokalaemia  as its binding to Na+K+-ATPase \\nis increased, thus increasing digitalis toxicity.  \\n2) It is contraindicated in elderly and in  patients  having  severe renal or hepatic \\ndisease . \\n3) It is con traindicated in myocardial  infarction  as severe arrhythmias may \\ndevelop.  \\n4) It is contraindicated in thyrotoxicosis as the patient’s responsiveness \\ndecreases , and  arrhythmias may also  develop.  \\n5) It is contraindicated in ventricular  tachycardia  as it may precip itate \\nventricular fibrillation.  \\n6) It is contraindicated in Wolff -Parkinson -White Syndrome as it may result \\nin ventricular failure.  \\n7) Administration of digitalis in patients with a partial A -V block  may convert \\nit into a complete A -V block.  \\n8) Digoxin is contrain dicated in myxoedema as its elimination rate decreases, \\nthus, cumulative toxicity of digitalis may be seen.  \\n \\n1.2.3.8.  Treatment of Digitalis Toxicity  \\nThe cases of digitalis toxicity can be treated in the following ways:  \\n1) Withdrawal: Administration of digitalis shoul d either be stopped  or the dose \\nshould  be reduced based on  the severity of toxicity. Use of potassium \\ndepleting diuretics should  be discontinued.  \\n2) Potassium Repletion:  KCl is administered by oral route (or by slow IV drip) \\nin a dosage of 2gm in every 4 hour s. During this time, ECG of the patient \\nshould  be continuously monitored. However, i n case of a severe AV block, \\nKCl should not be given.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

These  drugs are selective inhibitors of PDE -isoenzyme \\nIII, found in the cardiac and smooth muscles.  \\n \\n1.2.4.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nBipyridines increase the production of cAMP in the heart and blood vessels , and \\nthus exert a positive inotropic action along with vas odilator activities. Increased \\nlevels of intracellular cAMP enable the availability of more intracellular Ca2+ \\nions, t hus, a more positive inotropism may result.  \\n \\n1.2.4.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nCardiac output is increased . The peripheral vascular resistance and the afte r-load \\nare decreased with no significant change in heart rate and blood pressure. \\nBipyridines are used only for the treatment of heart failure or exacerbation of CCF.  \\n \\n1.2.4.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nGiven below are the adverse effects of bipyridine derivatives:  \\n1) Amrinone causes nausea, vomiting, liver enzyme changes, and occasionally \\nthrombocytopenia . \\n2) Milrinone may cause cardiac arrhythmia, bone marrow depression, and liver \\ntoxicity.  \\n \\nDue to these adverse effects, these agents are used for short -term therapy only.  \\n \\n1.2.5.  β-Adre nergic  Agonists  \\nThe discovery of  \\uf0621-agonists has sufficed the search for a positive inotropic \\uf062-\\nagonist with minimal positive chronotropic and arrhythmogenic potential, with \\ndobutamine being the most potential one amongst these agents.  \\n \\n1.2.5.1.

Mechanism of Action  \\nDiuretics increase the excretion of salt and water. This in turn decreases the \\nventricular pre -load and the cardiac size, improves pump function , and helps \\nrelieve oedema. In CHF patients, aldosterone promotes fibrosis in the heart and \\nblood vessels. This effect of aldosterone is antagonised by spironolactone (an \\naldosterone antagonist).  \\n \\n1.2.6.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nDiuretics are used in the management of all stages of CHF. Furosemide is a very \\nefficient diuretic  in treating acute left ventricular failure (cardiac asthma).  \\n \\n1.2.6.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nThe adverse effects of various classes of diuretics are:  \\n1) Loop Diuretics : Hypokalae mia is a common adverse effect. Patients on \\nlong-term diuretics require potassium supplements and regular \\nmonitoring. At high doses, hyponatraemia may occur, whi ch needs \\ncareful supervision in heart failure patients. Ototoxicity  characterised \\nwith tinnitus, vertigo and deafness also occurs at high doses of loop \\ndiuretics.  Therefore, intravenous administration of furosemide should not \\nbe faster than 4mg/min.  \\n2) Thiazi de Diuretics : Due to  potassium and sodium loss, the adverse effects \\nof thiazide diuretics are similar to those of loop diuretics.  However, the \\npotassium loss is reduced  when ACE inhibitors are simultaneously \\nprescribed . Diabetic patients  need monitoring as  diabetes may  occur  with \\nthiazide diuretics . Impotence as well as sensitivity may also develop  due to \\nthe presence of sulphonamide in the drug s. \\n3) Aldosterone Antagonists : Adverse effects include  fibrosis, hypertrophy , \\narrhythmogenesis,  and hyperkalaemia, wh ich require  regular monitoring \\nbecause of its potentially lethal effects in CHF patients due to renal \\nfailure.  \\n \\nHyponatraemia and  feminisation such as gynaecomastia are other adverse \\neffects.

Pharmacological Actions  \\nThe pharmacolog ical actions of angiotensin antagonists are:  \\n1) Reduction in peripheral arterial resistance and after -load.  \\n2) Reduction in aldosterone secretion, thus decreasing the retention of salt and \\nwater. This causes venodilatation and reduces pre -load.  \\n3) Reduction in angiotensin concentration in the tissues, thus reducing \\nangiotensin -induced tissue norepinephrine release.  \\n4) Reduction in the long -term remodelling of heart and blood vessels.  \\n \\n1.2.7.3.

Adverse Effects  \\nAngiotensin antagonists give  rise to occasional adverse effects that include \\nhypotension, hyperkalemia, angioedema, cough, and syncope. Several studies \\nhave suggested that the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors are reduced when \\nthey are given along  with aspirin.

Introduction  \\nA condition in which the blood pressure of systemic artery increases beyond the \\nnormal pressure is known as hypertension . Therefore to deliver blood to tissues, \\nthe heart works harder to overcome the increased systemic pressure. This \\nincreased systemic arterial pressure puts strain on the heart and other arteries, \\nthus resulting in high blood pressure .  \\n \\nBase d on the degree of severity, hypertension can be graded as:  \\n1) Mild: Diastole up to 104 mmHg,  \\n2) Moderate:  Diastole105 -114mmHg, and  \\n3) Severe:  Diastole more than 115 mmHg.  \\n \\nSymptoms  of hypertension are:  \\n1) Chest pain,  2) Confusion,  \\n3) Ear noise or buzzing (tinnitus),  4) Irreg ular heartbeat (arrhythmia),  \\n5) Nosebleed (epistaxis),  6) Exhaustion (lethargy), and  \\n7) Vision changes.   \\n \\nTherapy for hypertensive patients aims at reducing the increased blood pressure. \\nThis is accomplished by administration of drugs from different classes; t reatment \\nis often given in the form of a combination of several agents. If left untreated, it \\nwould result in organ damage, thus an increased risk for MI and stroke.  \\n \\n1.3.2.

Diuretics  \\nDrugs promoting urine output are known as diuretic s. They act directly on the \\nkidneys and primarily increase the excretion of water and ions [so dium (Na+), \\nchloride ( Cl−) or bicarbonates (\\n\\uf02d\\n3 HCO )] from the body.  \\n \\nThe antihypertensive action of diuretics is that they promote the excretion of \\nsodium and water resulting in:  \\n1) Decreased p lasma volume \\uf0ae \\uf0af cardiac output \\uf0ae \\uf0af BP \\n2) Decreased body sodium \\uf0ae relaxation of vascular smooth m uscles (due to \\nNa+ ion depletion in the vascular smooth muscle) \\uf0ae \\uf0af PVR \\uf0ae \\uf0af BP. \\n \\nThe amount of diuretic required will be reduced if the intake of dietary salt is \\nrestricted. Some common drugs used as diuretics are:  \\n1) Thiazides:  These diuretics ( e.g., hydroch lorothiazide and chlorthalidone) are \\nthe inexpensive first -line antihypertensive agents. They are commonly used \\nin hypertension treatment.  \\n2) Loop Diuretics: These diuretics ( e.g., furosemide, bumetanide, and \\ntorsemide) are powerful diuretics but have low an tihypertensive efficacy. \\nThey are used only in hyper tensive  patients having chronic renal failure or \\ncongestive heart failure. They are included in the treatment of malignant \\nhypertension and hypertension with hypervolemia ( e.g., renal \\ninsufficiency).  \\n3) Potassium -Sparing  Diuretics: These diuretics ( e.g., spironolactone, \\namiloride, and triamterene) have comparatively low efficacy; however, they \\ncorrect the po tassium loss caused by thiazide  and loop diuretics. They are \\nused in combination with hydrochlorothiaz ide. \\n \\n1.3.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nThe three commonly used diuretics act as follows:  \\n1) Thiazide s and Thiazide -like Diuretics:  Thiazide ( e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) \\nand thiazide -like diuretics ( e.g., chlorthalidone, indapamide, and metolazone) \\nincrease the excretion of Na+ ions t hrough urine by inhibiting the sodium -\\nchloride pump in the early segment of the distal convoluted tubule. This \\ninitially reduces the plasma volume, which increases the plasma renin \\nactivity and aldosterone. Ultimately, vascular resistance decrea ses by some \\nuncertain mechanisms because plasma volume approaches the pre -treatment \\nlevels.  \\n2) Loop Diuretics:  These diuretics act at the thick ascending loop of Henle to \\nprevent the reabsorption of Cl− and Na+ ions from the urine.

Amiloride and triamterene inhibit the Na/proton exchanger \\nin the distal and collecting tubules. They block the epithelial sod ium \\ntransport channel. Spironolactone inhibits the Na/K exchanger affected by \\naldosterone, as it is a potent non -selective aldosterone blocker which \\ninteracts with androgen and progesterone receptors.  \\n \\n1.3.3.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nDiuretics are used in the treatment o f the following conditions:  \\n1) Thiazide or thiazide -like diuretics are effective in reducing the incidences of \\nstrokes, heart failure, or total cardiovascular mortality.  \\n2) Combination of a thiazide diuretic and potassium -sparing diuretic in a fixed \\ndose reduce s the potassium and magnesium wasting.  \\n3) Diuretics can be effectively used in obese, elderly, and diabetic patients. They \\nare used in patients with systolic heart failure and excess sodium intake.  \\n4) Thiazide diuretics increase calcium level and decrease osteo porosis.  \\n5) Spironolactone reduces mortality and morbidity in cases of advanced heart \\nfailure.  \\n6) Eplerenone decreases cardiovascular mortality in patients who sustained a \\nmyocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction. This drug  is useful in \\nthe treat ment of resistant hypertension and diabetes mellitus.  \\n \\nLoop diuretics are ineffective in hypertensive patients having normal renal \\nfunction. Loop diuretics are used in patients with serum cre atinine level more \\nthan 2.5mg/dl . Intravenous doses of furosemide  in cases of heart failure produce \\nan acute vasodilator effect.  \\n  \\n1.3.3.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nThiazide diuretics  give rise to many metabolic effects such as hypercalcaemia, \\nhypokalaemia, hypernatremia, hypomagnesaemia, hypercalcaemia, \\nhyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and hyperuricemia; however, in low doses, \\ntheir side effects are minimised.

Furosemide either alone  or in combination with \\nother antihypertensive drugs is used for treating hypertension.  \\n3) Spironolactone:  This potassium sparing diuretic antagonises the aldosterone \\nin the distal renal tubules. It is used in the treatment of refractory oedema in \\npatients wi th CHF , nephrotic syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis.  \\n \\n1.3.4.  Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors  \\nACE inhibitors  act by inhibiting the action of ACE enzyme. The y competitivel y \\ninhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II occurring in the presence \\nof angiotensin -converting enzyme. This results in lower levels of angiotensin II, \\nwhich is a potent vasoconstrictor. Lower levels of angiotensin II increase plasma \\nrenin activity and reduce aldosterone secretion.  \\n \\n1.3.4.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nACE inhibitors slow down the formation of angiotensin II and as a result, \\nvascular resistance, blood volume, and blood pressure are reduced. Renin is an \\nenzyme which the kidneys release in res ponse to reduced renal blood circulation \\nor hyponatremia. This enzyme acts in the plasma angiotens inogen to produce \\nangiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II (mainly in the lungs).  \\n \\nAngiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and also helps in sodium retention by \\nreleasing aldosterone. Angiotensin II is converted to angiotensin III in adrenal \\ngland. Aldosterone release is stimulated by both angiotensin II and angiotensin \\nIII. Angiotensin I is inactive in the cardiovascular system, while angio tensin II \\nhas some cardiovascular -renal actions. The angiotensin -converting enzyme is \\nmostly found in the lungs; however they are also found in kidneys, central \\nnervous system, and some other body tissues also.  \\n \\n1.3.4.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nThe ACE inhibitors have the  following therapeutic uses:   \\n1) Hypertension: They are the first line drugs for the treatment of all grades of \\nhypertension. Around 50% of patients respond to monotherapy with ACE \\ninhibitors, and majority of the remaining respond to the combination of ACE \\ninhibitors with diuretics or β -blockers. The hypotensive effect of lower doses \\ndevelops over 2 -3 weeks.  \\n2) Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):  They cause arteriolar as well as \\nvasodilatation in CHF patients, and also reduce both after -load and pre -load. \\nThey do not  produce any direct myocardial action, thus increasing stroke \\nvolume and cardiac output while reducing the heart rate. Accumulated salt \\nand water are lost due to improved renal perfusion and abolition of \\nmineralocorticoid mediated Na+ ion retention occurs.   \\n3) Myocardial Infarction (MI):  Oral administration of ACE inhibitors is \\ncontinued for 6 weeks . It results in reduction of the early and long -term \\nmortality, regardless of the presence or absence of systolic dysfunction, \\nprovided hypotension is avoided.

AC E inhibitors improve \\nthis condition and are lifesaving.  \\n \\n1.3.4.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nIn most of the patients , ACE inhibitors do not produce any side effects or \\ntoxicities but some of  the rarely occurring or d ose related adverse effects are \\ndizziness,  angioedema,  loss of taste,  photosensitivity,  severe hypotension,  dry \\ncough,  hyperkalaemia,  blood dyscrasias, and  renal impairment.  \\n \\n1.3.4.4.  Individual Drugs  \\nThe commonly used ACE inhibitors are discussed below:  \\n1) Captopril: It is a sulfhydryl -containing dipeptide substitute of proli ne. It \\nabolis hes the pressor action of only a ngiotensin I, i.e., it does not block the \\nangiotensin II receptors. It is a potent and competitive ACE inhibitor, which \\nis responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II  (an agent \\nwhich regula tes blood pressure and is a key component of the RAAS) . \\n \\nCaptopril administered with thiazide diuretics is used for treating essential or \\nrenovascular hypertension. In combination with other drugs ( e.g., cardiac \\nglycosides, diuret ics, and β -adrenergic bloc kers), it is used to treat congestive \\nheart failure. It improves the survival in patients having left ventricular \\ndysfunction following myocardial infarction.  \\n \\nStudies show that if daily dose is kept below 150mg, captopril is well -\\ntolerated in most of the patients, but some mild adverse reactions  like \\nhypotension,  hyperkalaemia,  cough,  rashes, urticaria,  angioedema,  dysgeusia, \\nfetopathic,  headache, dizziness, nausea, bowel upset,  granulocytopenia, \\nproteinuri a, and acute renal failure, may occur.  \\n2) Enalapril: It is the second drug of this class which is a prodrug, converted \\ninto enalaprilat (a tripeptide analogue). This converted form is not effective \\norally due to poor absorption, thus is available as injectable preparation. \\nEnalaprilat is a potent and  competi tive ACE blocker, which is responsible for \\nthe conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.   \\n \\nEnalaprilat is used in essential or renovascular hypertension and symptomatic \\ncongestive heart failure, either alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

In comparison to ACE inhibitors, ARBs cause more \\ncomplete antagonism of angiotensin II, as angiotensin II can also be produced by \\nnon-ACE pathway s (figure 1. 3). \\n \\nARBs are preferred over ACE inhibitors because they do not increase bradykinin \\nwhich causes dry cough.  \\n \\n1.3.5.2.

Clonidine, \\uf061-\\nmethyldopa, guanabenz, and guanfacine are the examples  of centrally acting \\nsympatholytic drugs. Some of the common members of this class are:  \\n1) Methyld opa: It is an α2-adrenergic agonist having central and peripheral \\nnervous s ystem effects. It is mainly used  as an antihypertensive agent.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nIn the CNS, methyldopa gets decarboxylated to α -methyl  noradrenaline which \\nstimulates the central α -adrenergic receptors. As a result, the sympathetic \\noutflow from the CNS is reduced, resulting in decreased blood pressure.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses  \\nMethyldopa is used in hypertension. It was one of the earliest \\nantihypertensive agents available and is still used widely.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nNasal stuffiness, headache, sedation, mental depression, dryness of mouth, \\nbradycardia, impotence, extrapyramidal symptoms (due to false transmitter), \\ngynaecomastia, and haemolytic anaemia (rarely) are some common adverse \\neffects of methyldop a. \\n \\n2) Clonidine: It is an imidazoline -derivative and is a centrally -acting α2-\\nadrenergic agonist. It crosses the blood -brain barrier and acts on the \\nhypothalamus to decrease the blood pressure.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nClonidine stimulates α 2-adrenergic recepto rs in the CNS and reduces the \\nsympathetic tone, which further decreases the systolic and diastolic blood \\npressure and heart rate.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses  \\ni) In hypertension,  \\nii) To treat withdrawal symptoms in opioid and alcohol addicts,  \\niii) As a pre-anaesthetic agent,  \\niv) As an anti-diarrh oeal in diabetic neuropathy, and  \\nv) For prophylaxis of migraine.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n",

Adrenergic Neuron Blockers  \\nAdrenergic neuron blockers  act directly on α - or β-receptors, and produce similar \\neffects as those produced by the stimulation of sympathetic nerves or by the \\nrelease of  epinephrine from the medulla of  adrenal gland. Adrenergic neuron \\nblockers are primarily used in hypertension and hypertensive emergen cies. \\n \\nThe adverse effects produced by these agents include  postural hypotension, \\nweakness, worsening of CHF, diarrhoea, delayed ejaculation, and nasal congestion.  \\n \\nIndividual Drugs  \\n1) Reserpine:  It is an alkaloid obtained from the roots of the plant Rauwolfi a \\nserpentin a. It is a slow acting drug which shows its complete effect within 2 -\\n3 weeks. Its hypotensive action is due to depletion of NA from peripheral \\nadrenergic nerve endings. It has both central and peripheral actions.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nReserpine a cts by inhibiting the uptake and storage of DA and NA (vesicular \\ncatecholamines), as it can enter the adrenergic neuron to bind with the \\nstorage vesicle  (figure 1. 4). The catecholamines leak into the cytoplasm and \\nare destroyed there by MAO  enzyme.

It prevents \\nthe norepinephrine  (NE)  release at nerve endings and ca uses NE depletion in \\nperipheral sympathetic nerve terminals and tissues.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nGuanethidine acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction and inhibits or \\ninterferes with NE release and/or distribution. It is taken up by the NE \\ntransporters,  and becomes concentrated in NE transmitter vesicles, where it \\nreplaces the NE.  \\n \\nThis gradually depletes the NE stores in the nerve endings. Within the \\nterminal , guanethidine inhibits NA release in response to an action \\npotential.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses  \\nGuanet hidine is used either alone or as an adjunct in moderate and severe \\nhypertension. It is also used in renal hypertension.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nThe side effects  of guanethidine  are orthostatic and exercise hypotension , \\nsexual dysfunction, and diarrhoea.  \\n \\n1.3.7.3.  Sympatholytics (Adrenergic Receptor Blockers)  \\nAdrenergic receptor blockers interrupt with the functioning of sympathetic \\nnervous system. They block the impulse transmission and sympathetic  nervous \\nsystem stimulation at adrenergic neurons or adrenergic receptor sites.

The \\uf0611-blockers reverse the vasoconstriction effects of NE and \\nepinephrine;  thus due to selective \\uf0611-blockade, a decrease in blood pressure is \\nobserved. \\uf061-receptor blockers cau se both  venous and arterial dilatation.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

It is used to diagnose the pheochromocytoma ( tumours  of adrenal \\ngland  which secretes adrenal ine and NA). Phentolamine mesylate when \\ngiven to an individual with pheo chromocytoma in the dose of 5mg  via \\nintravenous route, it reduces the blood pressur e (35mmHg systolic and \\n25mmHg diastolic ) within 2 minutes. The similar reduction is observed in \\npatie nts with essential hypertension (taking a sedative or an antihypertensive \\ndrug) or having concomitant renal failure. Phentolamine in 2.5-10mg dose is \\ngiven through intravenous route for the treatment of severe hypertension (due \\nto catecholamine release dur ing management of pheochromocytoma).  \\n2) Phenoxybenzamine:  It is a long acting α -adrenergic blocking drug, used in \\nthe pre -operative preparation for the treatment of pheochromocytoma. It  \\ncontrols hypertension, expands the plasma volume, and prevents \\nintraoper ative hypertensive episodes. In combination  with a β-adrenergic \\nblocker, it is used for long -term management of pheochromocy toma (which \\ncannot be operated) . \\n3) Prazosin: It is a selective α 1-receptor blocker , which reduces the preload and \\nafterload. It produc es a lower degree of reflex tachycardia , and has been \\nproved to be valuable for monotherapy of hypertension and also in \\ncombination therapy with other drugs. Its continuous use results in salt and \\nwater retention and this accentuates postural hypotension.  \\n \\nβ-Blockers  \\nThese agents act by inhibiting adrenergic response mediated by β -receptors.

It prevents reflex \\ntachycardia when given in combination with vasodilators. It prevents tolerance \\ndevelopment even on long -term use i n combination with a diuretic.  \\n \\nThe adverse effects caused by pr opranolol are the results of β -blocking actions, \\nviz., lowered myocardial reserve, peripheral vascular insufficiency, asthma, and \\ndiabetes mellitus. Its withdrawal after prolonged use causes nervousness, \\ntachycardia, precipitation of hypertension, angina, or myocardial inf arction (due \\nto up -regulation of β -receptors).

Mechanism of Action  \\nCCBs act by blocking or altering the cell membrane calcium flux. Calcium \\nchannel blockers of class dihydropyridine lower the blood pressure  via arteriolar \\nand venous vaso dilation, while non -dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers \\n(e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) have less potent vasodilation properties, and reduce  \\nthe blood pressure through peripheral vasodilation and negative inotropic effect.  \\n \\n1.3.8.3.

Verapamil can be \\nused to reduce n octurnal leg cramps.  \\n \\n1.3.8.4.  Adverse Effects  \\nThe common adverse effects of calcium channel blockers are d izziness,  \\nheadache,  peripheral oedema (more than with verapamil and diltiazem; more \\ncommon in women),  flushing,  tachycardia,  rash, and  gingival hyperplasia.  \\n \\n1.3.8.5.

It contain s a dihydropyridine moiety with a carboxylic \\nacid group . \\n \\n1.3.9.  Vasodilators  \\nVasodilators cause vasodilation by directly relaxing the vascula r smooth muscles. \\nThis effect is dire ct because it does not depend on the innervation of vascular \\nsmooth muscles and is not controlled by various receptors, like adrenoceptors, \\ncholinoreceptors, or histaminic receptors, on which classical transmitters and \\nmediators act.  \\n \\nVasodilators reduce the total peripheral resistance , thus correct the hemodynamic \\nabnormality which elevates the  blood pressure in primary hypertension. These \\nagents directly act on vascular smooth muscle s, therefore are effective in \\nloweri ng blood pressure, regardless of the cause of hypertension. Vasodilators do \\nnot cause orthostatic hypotension and impotence as they do not inhibit the \\nactivity of sympathetic nervous system like other antihypertensive drugs.  \\n \\nThe vasodilators relax the ar terial smooth muscles more than the venous smooth \\nmuscles; thus they reduce postural hypotension.  \\n \\n1.3.9.1.

For example,  the CCBs  either inhibit or limit the \\ninflux of Ca2+ ions through the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane via voltage -\\ndependent channels. This is how the CCBs restrict the amount of intrac ellular Ca2+ \\nions available in free form to interact with smooth muscle contractile proteins.   \\n \\nOther vasodilators ( e.g., diazoxide and minoxidil) dilate the blood vessels by \\nactivating the potassium channels in vascular smooth muscles. Relaxation of \\nvascu lar smooth muscles occurs due to increase in potassium conductance which \\ncauses hyperpolarisation in cell membrane.  \\n \\nAnother class of drugs known as nitrovasodilators  (e.g., nitroprusside) activate the \\nsoluble guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth muscles and increase the intracellular \\nlevels of cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP), thereby causing relaxation in \\nvascular smooth muscle s. It has been seen that nitrovasodilators act like endogenous \\nvasodilator released by a variety of endothelial cells of blo od vessels. This \\nendogenous vasodilator (formerly named as Endothelial -Derived Relaxing Factor or \\nEDRF) is nitric oxide or a closely related nitrosothiol compound.  \\n \\n1.3.9.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nVasodilators have the following therapeutic uses : \\n1) Nitroprusside is the dr ug of choice in hypertensive emergencies.  \\n2) It is used when myocardial work is to be reduced for a shorter time period (as \\nin myocardial infarction).  \\n \\n1.3.9.3.

Classification  \\nThe anti -anginals are divided into the following groups:  \\n1) Vasodilator Drug s \\ni) Organic Nitrites and Nitrates : Amyl ni trite, Isosorbide dinitrate,  \\nIsosorbide mononitrate, and  Nitro glycerine.  \\nii) Calcium Channel Blockers : Amlodipine,  Nifedipine,  Diltiazem, and  \\nVerapamil.  \\niii) Potassium Channel Opener : Nicorandil.  \\n2) \\uf062-Adrenoceptor Antagonists ( \\uf062-Blockers) : Atenolol,  Metoprolol,  Nadolo l, \\nand Propranolol.  \\n3) Metabolic Modifiers : Ranolazine  and Trimetazidine.  \\n \\n1.4.3.  Organic Nitrites and Nitrates  \\nOrganic nitrites and nitrates are simple nitric and \\nnitrous acid esters of glycerol having dif ferent \\nvolatilities ( e.g., isosorbide dinitrate and isosorbide \\nmononitrate are so lids at room temperature, \\nnitro glycerine is moderately volatile, and amyl \\nnitrite is highly volatile). These compounds are \\nused in angina pectoris. They rapidly reduce the \\nmyocardial oxygen demand, followed by rapid \\nrelief of symptoms. They are effective in classic as \\nwell as in variant angina pectoris.  \\n \\n1.4.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nNitrates inhibit coronary vasoconstriction or spasm \\nas a result of which perfusion of the myocardium \\nincreases, thus, relieving vasospastic angina. \\nNitrates also cause venodilation, resulting in \\ndecrease d preload and myocardial oxygen \\nconsumption. Due to this action, nitrates are \\neffectively used in classic angina.  \\n \\nIt is believed that organic nitrates ( e.g., nitro glycerine) act on vascular smooth \\nmuscle s and relax  them by their intracellular conversion to nitrite ions and then \\nto nitric oxide. It results in activation of guanylate cyclase and elevates  the levels \\nof cGMP .

If taken via sub -lingual route , it acts \\nrapidly and its action lasts for an hour.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nNitroglycerine acts by dilating the blood vessels , thus affecting  the vascular \\nsmooth muscles. It decreases the cardiac oxygen demand in case of stable \\nangina, and increases the oxygen supply in variant angina.  \\n \\nNitroglycreine is also available in the form  of patches and topical ointment. Its \\ntransdermal patches are us ed once daily due to their slower but longer effect . \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses  \\nNitroglycerine is administered sublingually for the treatment of acute anginal \\npain or for prevention of angina; w hile it’s intravenous administration helps \\nto reduce hypertension.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nNitroglycerine causes headache (due to vascular dilation), syncope (due to \\npostural hypotension and reflex tachycardia), apprehension, blurred vision, \\nweakness, vertigo, and dizziness. Some serious adverse effects are \\ncirculatory collapse and anaphylactic reactions.  \\n \\n2) Isosorbide Mononitrate and Isosorbide Dinitrate: These drugs provide  \\nlonger duration of action than nitroglycerine. Isosorbide mononitrate is \\navailable as chewable tablets; while isosorbide dinitrate  is formulated as \\nsublingual tablet s. \\n \\nBoth isosorbide mononitrate and isosorbide dinitrate are long -acting nitrates. \\nThe former  does not undergo the first -pass metabolism. It decreases pre -load, \\nleft ventricular end volume, diastolic pressure, and thus the m yocardial \\noxygen consumption. The latter  relaxes the vascular smooth muscles to dilate \\nthe peripheral blood vessels.  \\n \\nBoth the drugs  effectively treat all types of angina pectoris. Isosorbide \\ndinitrate relieves acute anginal attack and manages long -term a ngina \\npectoris. Isosorbide mononitrate is not used to treat acute attacks of angina.  \\n \\nThe most common adverse effects of these drugs are h eadache,  hypotension,  \\nfacial flushing,  dizziness,  nausea,  vomiting,  fatigue,  and weakness.

Adverse Effects  \\nCCBs  give rise to c ardiovascular adverse effects. Blood pressure reduces due to \\ndilation of peripheral arterioles , resulting in induced reflex tachycardia. This \\nreaction mainly occurs with nifedipine and rarely with verapamil and diltiazem. \\nDue to their suppressant effects o n the heart, verapamil and diltiazem should be \\nused carefully in patients taking β-blockers and suffering from  bradycardia, heart \\nfailure, or AV block.  \\n \\n1.4.4.4.  Individual Drugs  \\nSome commonly used CCBs are described below:  \\n1) Verapamil:  It is a calcium channel blocker of class IV anti -arrhythmic \\nagent.

Peripheral vasodilating effects may also occur which \\nreduces the afterload and blood pressure. The peripheral effects of verapamil \\ninclude headache, reflex tachycardia, and fluid reten tion. \\n \\n2) Nifedipine:  This drug is a long - as well as short -acting 1,4 -dihydropyridine \\ncalcium channel blocker.

It can also be used as a \\nfirst line agent for left ventricular hypertrophy and for isolated systolic \\nhypertension (long -acting agents).  \\n \\nCommon adverse effects of nifedipine  include palpitation, flushing, ankle \\noedema, hypotension, headache, drowsiness, and nausea.  \\n \\n3) Bepridil: It is a long -acting, non -elective, calcium channel blocker showing \\nsignificant anti -anginal activity. It shows significant coronary vasodilation \\nand moderate peripheral effects.  \\n \\nIt gives inhibitory effects on the slow calcium (L -type) as well as fast sodium \\ninward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscles.

Mechanism of Action  \\nPotassium channel openers activate (open) the ATP -sensitive K+-channels in \\nvascular smooth muscles.

Introduction  \\nArrhythmia  is a common disorder of cardiac excitation, which may be benign but \\nmay also be fatal ( e.g., ventricular fibrillation following a heart attack). \\nAntiarrhythmic drugs are used to control or correct cardiac rhythm.  \\n \\nFour types  of arrhythmias are:  \\n1) Atrial fibrillation,  \\n2) Bradycardia,  \\n3) Tachycardia, and  \\n4) Ventricular arrhythmias.  \\n \\nThe symptoms  of arrhythmias are:  \\n1) Shortness of breath,  \\n2) Feeling tired or light -headed,  \\n3) Rapid thumping in chest or palpitations,  \\n4) Chest pain, and  \\n5) Losing consciousn ess.  \\n \\n1.5.2.  Classification  \\nThe classification of antiarrhythmic drugs is as follows:  \\n \\nTable 1. 1: Classes of Antiarrhythmic Drugs  \\nClasses  Basic Mechanism  Examples  \\nI Sodium Channel \\nBlock ers Reduce phase 0 slope and peak of action \\npotential.   \\nIA Moderate  Moder ate reduction in phase 0 slope; \\nincrease APD; increase ERP.

They \\nact by blocking myocardial Na+ ion channels. They are  mainly used for the \\ntreatment of supraventricular, nodal and ventricular arrhythmias , especially after \\nMI and DC shock.  \\n \\n1.5.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nAntiarrhythmic activity of sodium channel blockers is due to:  \\n1) Decrease in inflow of sodium during phase 0 which slo ws the maximum rate \\nof depolaris ation,  \\n2) Decrease in excitability and conduction velo city, \\n3) Prolongation of effective refractory period, and  \\n4) Decrease in slope of phase 4 spontaneous depolaris ation (automaticity).  \\n \\n1.5.3.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nThe sodium channel blockers have the following therapeutic uses:  \\n1) Treatment of supraventricular, nodal and ventr icular arrhythmias, especially \\nafter MI and DC shock.  \\n2) After treatment of atrial flutter and fibrillation to maintain sinus rhythm.  \\n \\n1.5.3.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nThe adverse effects of sodium channel blockers are marked depression of AV \\nconduction , hypotension,  bradycar dia, anorexia,  nausea, and  vomiting.  \\n \\n1.5.3.4.  Individual Drugs  \\nClass I antiarrhythmic agents are further classified into:  \\n1) Moderate (Class IA): These drugs slow the rate of rise of action potential \\nand prolong the duration of action potential. They block Na+ ion channels and \\nprolong the repolarisation time.  \\nExamples  \\ni) Quinidine: It is the prototype of Class IA drug. Because of its \\nconcomitant Class III activity, it can precipitate arrhythmias such as \\npolymorphic ventricular tachycardia ( torsades de pointes ), which ca n \\ndegenerate into ventricular fibrillation. Due to the toxic effects,  the \\nclinical uses of quinidine are  replaced with calcium antagonists (like \\namiodarone and verapamil ). \\n \\nMechanism of Action: Quinidine binds to open and inactivated Na+ ion \\nchannels to pr event the influx of Na+ ions; thus slowing down the rapid \\nupstroke during p hase 0 . It also reduces the slope of p hase 4 spontaneous \\ndepolarisation and inhibits potassium channels. These actions result in \\nslow conduction velocity and increased refractorines s. \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses: Quinidine is used in the treatment of a wide variety \\nof arrhythmias including atrial, AV -junctional, and ventricular \\ntachyarrhythmia. It is used to maintain sinus rhythm after direct -current \\ncardioversion of atrial flutter or fibrilla tion and to prevent frequent \\nventricular tachycardia.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

It is an \\nalternative to lidocaine in preventi on and treatment of frequent VPBs \\n(Ventricular Premature Beats ) and sustained tachycardia after MI. Its use is \\nalso declining because of frequent dosing and unacceptable adverse effects.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects: With chronic use, procainamide causes a high \\nincide nce of side effects, including a reversible lupus erythematous -like \\nsyndrome. Toxic concentrations of procainamide may cause asystole or \\ninduction of ventricular arrhythmias. CNS side effects include \\ndepression, hallucination, and psychosis.  \\n \\n2) Weak  (Class IB): The characteristic effects of these drugs are reduced rate \\nof rise of action potential and reduced or unchanged APD ( Action Potential \\nDuration ). The drugs of Class IB rapidly associate and dissociate from the \\nsodium channels. Thus , their actions are m anifested when the cardiac cells \\nare depolarised or firing rapidly.  \\n \\nExamples  \\ni) Lidocaine : It is a local anaesthetic which shortens phase 3 repolarisation \\nand decreases the duration of action potential . Lidocaine is useful in \\ntreating ventricular arrhythmia s. It was the drug of choice for emergency \\ntreatment of cardiac arrhythmias. It  does not slow down conduction, thus \\nhas a little effect on the AV junction arrhythmia.  \\n \\nLidocaine  in higher doses causes cardiac and CNS manifestations.

It facilitates AV nodal \\nconduction , therefore can be suitably used in supraventricuar arrhythmia \\nassociated with AV blocks such as digitalis -induced atrial tachycardia \\nand digoxin -induced ventricular tachycardia.  \\n \\nPhenytoin is mainly used in children with con genital heart disease and \\ncongenital prolonged QT syndrome to treat ventricular tachycardia.  \\n \\nSome common adverse effects of phenytoin include decreased \\ncoordination, mental confusion, nervousness, slurred speech, trouble \\nwith breathing, speaking, or swal lowing, unsteadiness, trembling, and \\nother problems with muscle control or coordination.  \\n \\n3) Strong (Class IC): Drugs  of this class are powerful blockers of fast Na+ ion \\nchannels, and thus reduce upstroke of AP in normal and diseased \\nmyocardium. There is dela yed inactivation of slow Na+ ion channels during \\ndown slope of AP , and this result  in prolongation of APD. In addition, there \\nis inhibition of delayed rectifier K+ current (less K+ efflux) , so the APD is \\nprolonged in His Bundle and Purkinje fibre system.  \\n \\nThese changes create heterogeneity of impulse conduction, non -uniform \\nslowing and unidirectional block predisposing to development of re -entry \\n(proarrhythmic potential). Arrhythmias are more likely to occur in structural \\nheart disease, sympathetic over ac tivity and at faster heart rates.  \\n \\nExamples  \\ni) Flecainide: It blocks Na+ and K+ ion channels in normal and ischemic \\nmyocardium, t hus slow ing down the recovery of blocked Na+ ion \\nchannels. It further slows down  the conduction of electrical impulse in \\nthe heart , i.e., reduces excitability.  \\n \\nFlecainide  is useful in terminating PSVT, and treating atrial fibrillation \\nand atrial flutter occurring in normal heart. It stabilises the heart rhythm \\nwhen the heart beats too fast or beats irregular ly. \\n \\nCommon adverse effec ts of flecainide are:  \\na) During Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), it causes \\nserious ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden death.  \\nb) During the treatment of atrial fibrillation, it should  be administered \\nwith a rate -reducing drug (digoxin) otherwise  paradoxical \\ntachycardia may occur.  \\nc) It is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome, bundle branch block and \\nshould be avoided in acute MI.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 50}),\n",

QT interval does not change but QRS and PR \\nintervals are prolonged. It is effective orally and is metabolised by CYP \\n2D6 (in persons with CYP 2D6 deficiency, it is slowly metabolised).  \\n \\nPropafenone  acts by slowing down the influx of Na+ ions into the cardiac \\nmuscle  cells, thus decreasing the excitability of the cells.  \\n \\nPropafenone is used in life -threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, for \\nsuppressing supraventricular tachycardia in Wolff -Parkinson -White \\n(WPW) syndrome, i n recurrent atrial fibrillation, and  in suppression of \\nparoxysms of atrial fibrillation.  \\n \\nThe main adverse effects  of propafenone  are constipation, and sometime s \\nit worsens CHF.

They are highly effective in arrhythmias in which \\nexcess of catecholamine plays a role after MI, CHF, pheochromocytoma, anxiety, \\nanaesthesia and postoperative period, exercise and mitr al valve prolapse. Excess \\nof cAMP is considered to be responsible for causing ischemia induced \\nventricular fibrillation.  \\n \\n1.5.4.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nReduction in intracellular Ca++ ions leads to reduced phase 2 of AP. There is \\nreduction in SA nodal automaticity,  slowing of conduction, and prolongation of \\nERP ( Effective Refractive Period ) in AV node. They counteract catecholamine \\ninduced after depolarisations (arrhythmias) by reducing cAMP and Ca++ ion \\naccumulation.  \\n \\n\\uf062-blockers are also effective prophylactically in suppressing supraventricular \\ntachycardia because they suppress automaticity of ectopic foci and slow AV \\nnodal conduction , thereby reducing ventricular response in atrial fibrillation. \\nThey reduce cardiac contractility and blood pressure.  \\n \\n1.5.4.2.

This reduces the resting heart rate, \\ncardiac output, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and reflex orthostatic \\nhypotension.  \\n \\nPropranolol is used therapeutically for the management of hypertension,  \\nangina pec toris (with the exception of variant angina ), tachyarrhythmia,  \\nmyocardial infarction, tachycardia  or tremor  associated with anxiety , panic , \\nhyperthyroidism , or lithium therapy , migraine , cluster headache , and \\nhyperhidrosis.  \\n \\nThe adverse effects caused by p ropranolol include insomnia, vivid dre ams \\nand nightmares as it can cross the BBB much easily as compared to the less \\nlipophilic β-blockers due to high lipophilic nature.   \\n \\n2) Metoprolol:  It is a \\uf062-adrenergic antagonist used for the treatment of cardiac \\narrhythmia. Like propranolol, it can also b e metabolised easily and can \\npenetrate CNS. It reduces the risk of bronchospasm.  \\nMetoprolol is a β1-selective adrenergic receptor blocker , but at higher plasma \\nconcentrations it also inhibits β2-adrenoreceptors located in the bro nchial and \\nvascular muscul ature . \\n \\nMetoprolol is used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, angina \\npectoris, heart failure, and mild to moderate hypertension.

The blocking of K+ ion channel preve nts K+ \\nion efflux, thus the down slope of phase 3 of action potential is delayed. It \\nalso blocks the Na+ ion channels increasing their inactivation time in phase 3 \\nthus prolonging APD. The Na+ ion channels get recovered very quickly from \\nthis blockage. Ami odarone also blocks Ca++ ion chan nels resulting an altered \\nphase 4 of AP. It actively inhibits abnormal automaticity and slows \\nconduction by prolonging ERP in all tissues.  \\n \\nFollowing are the common therapeutic uses of amiodarone:  \\ni) Suppressing of chronic at rial fibrillation and for maintaining NSR after \\ncardioversion.  \\nii) Preventing recurrent ventricular extra systoles and VT alone or as an \\nadjunct to Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD).  \\niii) It is also used for suppressing atrial fibrillation in WPW syndrome.  \\n \\nThe adverse effects caused by amio darone may be cardiac and extra -cardiac:  \\ni) Cardiac adverse effects include hypotension (due to direct myoca rdial \\ndepression), vasodilation, b radycardia , and QT prolongation.  \\nii) If used for a long-term, amiodarone give some  extra -cardiac adverse \\neffects like pulmonary fibrosis, corneal micro deposits and halos in \\nvisual fields, optic neuritis, hepatic dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, \\nproximal muscle weakness, photodermatitis, slate blue discoloration of \\nskin, testicular f ailure, and thyroid malfunction.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

Introduction  \\nLipids or fats, which are usually transported in various combinations with \\nproteins (lipoproteins), play a key role in cardiovascular disorders. Lipids, \\nincluding cholesterol and trigl ycerides, are essential elements in the body. They \\nare synthesised in the liver; therefore, they can never be eliminated from the \\nbody. Dietary or drug therapy of elevated plasma cholesterol levels can reduce \\nthe risk of atherosclerosis, and subsequent car diovascular disease.  \\n \\nA patient with high serum cholesterol and increased Low -Density Lipoprotein \\n(LDL) is at risk of atherosclerotic coron ary disease and myocardial infar ction. \\nAtherosclerosis is a disorder in which lipid sub -groups [total cholesterol, \\ntriglycerides, Low -Density Lipoproteins (LDL), and High -Density Lipoproteins \\n(HDL)] in various proportions indicate risk factors for the individual.  \\n \\nAntihyperlipidemics are the group of drugs prescribed in adjuvant therapy to \\nreduce elevated cholesterol lev els in patients with high cholesterol and LDL \\nlevels in the blood. These medications are used to decrease the risk of \\narteriosclerosis.  \\n \\nThe major drugs for reduction of LDL cholesterol levels are bile acid \\nsequestrants and nicotinic acid. The fibric acid  derivatives and clofibrate \\n(Atromid -S) are less effective in reducing LDL cholesterol. The most effective \\nagents for reducing plasma LDL levels are the statins.  \\n \\n1.6.2.  Classification  \\nThe anti - hyperlipidemic drugs are classified  into: \\n1) HMG -CoA Reductase Inhibit ors (Statins):  Lovastatin, Simvastatin, \\nPravastatin, and Atorvastatin.  \\n2) Bile Acid Sequestrants (Resins): Cholestyramine and Colestipol.  \\n3) Fibric Acid Derivatives (Fibrates):  Clofibrate, Gemfibrozil, Bezafibrate, \\nand Fenofibrate.  \\n4) Triglyceride Synthesis and Lip olysis Inhibitors:  Nicotinic acid.  \\n5) Others:  Probucol and Omega -3 fatty acids.  \\n \\n1.6.3.  HMG -CoA Reductase Inhibitors  (Statins)  \\nStatins are the most effective and best tolerated agents used to treat \\nhyperlipidemia. Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl \\ncoenzyme reductase and also the most effective and best tolerated agents for \\ntreating hyperlipidemia.  \\n \\nThey catalyse an early, rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Hi gher \\ndoses are more potent and can even reduce the triglyceride levels caused by high \\nVLDL levels.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='56 Pharmacology -II \\n*  * 1.6.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nStatins inhibit the enzyme 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl -coenzyme A reductase \\n(HMG -CoA reductase) which catalyses the conversion of HMG -CoA  to \\nmevalonate. Mevalonate is required to initiate cholesterol biosynthesis and its \\nproduction is inhibited by statins. Statins act as a competitive inhibitor for HMG -\\nCoA which binds to the HMG -CoA reductase. Statins are  inactive in its native \\nform, so  the form in which they are administered is hydrolysed to the β -hydroxy \\nacid form and becomes active.  \\n \\n1.6.3.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nThe therapeutic uses of statins are:  \\n1) They are used for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke \\nin patients having symptomat ic atherosclerotic disease ( e.g., angina, transient \\nischemic  attacks, following acute myocardial infarction or stroke).  \\n2) They are used for primary prevention of arterial disease in patients having \\nhigh risk due to increased serum cholesterol concentration, specifically when \\nthere are other risk factors for atherosclerosis.  \\n3) Serum cholesterol level can be lowered by atorvastatin in patients with \\nhomozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.  \\n4) A bile acid binding resin is added to treatment with a statin in cases of  severe \\ndrug-resistant dyslipidaemia  (e.g., heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia).  \\n \\n1.6.3.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nStatins are generally well -tolerated and adverse  effects are very rare. However, \\nsome patients may experience some mild and transient reactions like h eadache, \\nrashes, and GI disturbances (dyspepsia, cramps, flatulence, constipation, and \\nabdominal pain).  \\n \\nSome serious side effects that may occur rarely are hepatotoxicity and myopathy. \\nHowever , some statins give more hazardous reactions than other s:  \\n1) Myo pathy/ Rhabdomyolysis: Sometimes statins can cause muscle injury. \\nMild injury characterise d by muscles ache, tenderness or weakness localised \\nto certain muscle group occurs in 5 -10% patients .   \\n2) Hepatotoxicity: It may develop in 0.5 -2% of patients treated fo r one or more \\nyear with statins . But jaundice and other clinical signs are very rare. Use of \\nstatin in patients with active liver  disease depends on the disease;   \\nfor example , statins should not be given to patients suffering from viral or \\nalcoholic hepati tis, while statins use is acceptable in patients of non -alcoholic \\nfatty liver disease.    \\n \\n1.6.3.4.  Individual Drugs  \\nSome commonly used statins are discussed below:  \\n1) Atorvastatin:  It is an aromatic heterocyclic compound belong ing to the class \\ndiphenylpyrroles, having  a structure based on a pyrrole ring linked to two \\nphenyl groups .', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",

It is a selective and \\ncompetitive inhibitor of HMG -CoA reductase enzyme which catalyses \\nconversion of HMG -CoA to mevalonate in t he cholesterol biosynthesis \\npathway.  \\n \\nAtorvastatin  has the following therapeutic uses:  \\ni) It may be used as a primary prevention in patients of multiple risk factors \\nfor Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and as secondary prevention in \\nindividuals with CHD to redu ce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), \\nstroke, angina, and revascularis ation procedures.  \\nii) It reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with Acute \\nCoronary Syndrome ( ACS).  \\niii) It may be used in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and \\nmixed dyslipidaemia , homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, \\nprimary dysbetalipoproteinemia, and/or hypertrigly ceridemia as an \\nadjunct to dietary therapy to decrease serum total and Low-Density \\nLipoprotein -Cholesterol (LDL -C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), an d \\ntriglyceride concentrations, while increasing High -Density Lipoprotein \\nCholesterol  (HDL -C) levels.  \\n \\nThe common adverse effects occurring with the use of atorvastatin include  \\nmuscle pain, confusion, memory problems, fever, unusual tiredness, dark \\ncoloured  urine, weight gain, and urinating less than usual or not at all.  \\n \\n2) Lovastatin:  It is used as a cholesterol -lowering agent.  It is a prodrug, \\nshowing structural similarity with HMG, a substituent of the endogenous \\nsubstrate of HMG -CoA reductase. It gets act ivated in vivo  by the hydr olysis \\nof lactone ring to form β -hydroxy acid. The hydrolysed lactone ring mimics \\nthe tetrahedral intermediate produced by the reductase. The resultant \\nhydrolysed lactone ring binds to HMG -CoA reductase with 20,000 times \\ngreater affinity than its natural s ubstrate. Thus , the bicyclic portion of \\nlovastatin binds to the coenzyme A portion of the active site.  \\n \\nLovastatin is used as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total -C, LDL -C, \\napo B, and TG levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and \\nmixed  dyslipidaemia . It is also used for primary prevention of CHD and for \\nslow progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with CHD . \\n \\nThe more common adverse effects of lovastatin include gastric disturbance s \\nlike (pain in abdominal area, nausea, heart burn, and constipation), headache, \\nweakness, muscle  pain, memory loss,  confusion, and inability to fall asleep.  \\n \\n1.6.4.  Bile Acid Sequestrants  (Resins)  \\nBile acid sequestrants bind with certain components of bile in the gastrointestinal \\ntract. They prevent the re -absorption of bile acids from the gut by disrupting the \\nenterohepatic circulation of bile acids by sequestering them. They may be used \\nfor purposes other than lowering cholesterol, but they are cla ssified as \\nhypolipidemic agents.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 57}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='58 Pharmacology -II \\n*  * 1.6.4.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nBile acid sequestrants are polymeric compounds which act as ion exchange \\nresins. They exchange anions (like Cl− ions) for bile acids by binding with \\nbile acid and sequestering them from enterohepatic circulation. They are not \\nwell-absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream because they have large \\npolymeric structures. Therefore, the bile acid sequestrants along with the bile \\nacid bound to the drug , are excreted via faeces after passing  through the \\ngastrointestinal tract.  \\n \\n1.6.4.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nBile acid sequestrants are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and \\ndyslipidemia as they help in decreasing the cholesterol levels, mainly low density \\nlipoprotein (commonly known as “bad cholesterol”). They act by inhibiting  the \\nre-absorption of bile acid, which is biosynthesised from cholesterol.  \\n \\nThey may cause pruritus during chronic liver diseases (such as cirrhosis ) \\nbecause the bile acids may deposit in the skin. Therefore, in patients with \\nchronic live r diseases, bile acid sequestrants may be used for the prevention \\nof pruritus.  \\n \\nThey are also used in the treatment of diarrhoea caused by excess bile salts \\nentering the colon rather than being absorbed at the end of the small intestine. \\nDiarrhoea caused by excessive bile is a possible side effect occurring after \\nsurgical removal of gallbladder.  \\n \\n1.6.4.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nBile acid sequestrants do not have any systemic side effects because they are \\ndesigned to stay in the gut. However, they may cause problems like constipation, \\ndiarrhoea, and flatulence in the gastrointestinal tract.  \\n \\n1.6.4.4.  Individual Drug - Cholestyramine  \\nCholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant which serves as ion exchange resins. It \\nis a quite hydrophilic compound, but insoluble in water.  \\n \\nCholestyram ine acts by preventing the reabsorption of bile in the gastrointestinal \\ntract.  It binds to bile as it is a strong anion exchange resin which can exchange \\nits chloride anions  with anionic bile acids in the GIT and bind them in the resin \\nmatrix strongly.  \\n \\nIt is used as an adjunctive therapy to diet for reducing the increased serum \\ncholesterol in the patients who have primary hypercholesterolemia (elevated \\nLDL cholesterol) and do not respond adequately to diet. It can also be used for \\npruritus associated wit h partial biliary obstruction.  \\n \\nCholestyramine gives rise to many  adverse effects which include mild \\nconstipation, diarrhoea, stomach pain, nausea, loss of appetite, weight changes, \\nbloating, hiccups, a sour taste in mouth, skin rashes, itching, irritation  of tongue \\nand around the rectal area, and muscle or joint pain.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 58}),\n",

The m ost common examples  of fibrates are gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, \\nciprofibrate , and fenofibrate. They are the most heterogeneous  lipid modifying \\ndrugs.  \\n \\n1.6.5.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nThe mechanism of action of fibrates is not completely understood but it is \\nbelieved tha t they increase peripheral clearance and reduce  hepatic \\ntriglyceride synthesis. The effects given by fibrates on blood lipids depend on \\ntheir binding to Peroxisome Proliferators Activator Receptors (PPARs) , \\nwhich  regulate  gene transcription. \\uf061, \\uf062, and \\uf067 are the three PPAR isotopes \\nthat have been identified.  \\n \\nFibrates act as agonists for the nuclear transcription factor Peroxisome \\nProliferators -Activated Receptor -alpha  (PPAR -alpha), at the molecular level. \\nThis mechanism is used by fibrates for the down reg ulation of the apolipoprotein \\nC-III (apo C -III) gene and up regulation of the genes for apolipoprotein A -I (apo \\nA-I), fatty acid transport protein, fatty acid oxidation, and LPL. Thus, VLDL \\ntriglycerides get reduced due to the enhanced catabolism of trigly cerides by LPL \\nalong with enhanced fatty acid oxidation.  \\n \\n1.6.5.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nThe fibrates are used in the following cases:  \\n1) Fibrates (gemfibrozil) are the first -line of drugs f or patients with type III \\nhyperlipidaemia  or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia . \\n2) They  are used to treat mixed hyperlipidaemia , where in the predominant \\nabnormality is hypertriglyceridemia (in combination with resins) and to treat \\nmoderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia.  \\n3) They are  used with statins in patients with high risk of CHD and mixed \\nhyperlipidaemia . But because of the increased risk of myopathy, careful \\nsafety monitoring is required.  \\n \\n1.6.5.3.  Adverse Effects  \\nGenerally, fibrates do not give an y adverse reaction and are well -tolerated in \\nmost of the patients. But in some patients minor side -effects like GI disturbance \\nsymptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea may be seen that are \\ncorrected by the discontinuation of the treatment.   \\n \\nAn important but rare adverse effect of fibrates is myositis with muscle pain and \\ntenderness and elevate d creatinine kinase levels.  \\n \\nfibrates Are contraindicated in patients of renal dysfunction , as they get \\naccumulated in the kidney leading to enhanced frequency of adverse effects \\nspecially myositis.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 59}),\n",

Individual Drug - Clofibrate  \\nClofibrate is an anti -lipidemic drug that lowers the elevated serum lipids by \\nreducing the very low -density lipoprotein fraction (S f 20-400) rich in \\ntriglycerides. Serum cholesterol may be decreased in those patients whose \\ncholesterol elevation is due to the presence of IDL as  a result of Type III \\nhyperlipoproteinemia.   \\n \\nClofibrate enhances lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis by increasing the activity \\nof extrahepatic Lipoprotein Lipase (LL). Degradation of chylomicrons converts \\nVLDLs to LDLs , which are further converted into HD Ls. These changes occur \\nby a minor increase in the secretion of lipids into bile and finally in the \\nintestine.  \\n \\nClofibrate also helps to inhibit the synthesis , and thus increases the clearance of \\napolipoprotein B (a carrier molecule for VLDL ).  \\n \\nClofibrate is used to treat primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III \\nhyperlipidaemia ) which does not respond adequately to diet. Thus , it helps to \\ncontrol high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels.  \\n \\nClofibrate  may cause diarrhoea, nausea, headache, dec reased sexual ability, \\nincreased appetite, slight weight gain,  muscle aches or cramps, sores in mouth \\nand on lips, stomach pain, gas, heartburn, unusual tiredness or weakness, and \\nvomiting.  \\n \\n1.6.6.  Triglyceride Synthesis and Lipolysis Inhibitors  \\nTriglyceride synthesis and lipolysis inhibitors act either by inhibiting the \\nsynthesis of triglyceride or by inhibiting  the process of lipolysis. These agents \\nreduce the level of LDL s and V LDL s in blood, and thus prevent the deposition of \\nlipid in blood vessels. Nicotinic acid is the most common example  of this class. \\nHigher doses of nicotinic acid help in the reduction of plasma lipid concentration.  \\n \\nIndividual Drug  \\n1) Nicotinic Acid ( Niacin ): Nicotinic acid is an organic compound that belongs \\nto the pyridine carboxylic acids group of compounds. At high concentrations, \\nthis drug gives cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effects, resulting in a \\ndecrease of LDL s and VLDL s and an increase in H DLs.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nNicotinic acid helps in the inhibition of release of free fatty acids from \\nadipose tissue and enhances the lipoprotein activity.

The following drugs are employed for their \\nhemodynamic effects:  \\n1) Sympathomimetic amines,  2) α-adrenoceptor blocking agents,  \\n3) Corticosteroids,  4) Oxygen,  \\n5) Cardiac glycosides,  6) Glucagon, and  \\n7) Dextrans.   \\n \\n2.1.2.1.  Sympathomimetic Amines  \\nSympathomimetic amines act via β 1-adrenoceptors in the heart, \\uf061- and β 2-\\nadrenoceptors in the blood vessels, and dopamine receptors in the cerebral, \\ncoronary, mesenteric, and renal vascular beds.  Patients  with shock resulting from \\ndecreased circulating volume of blood should  be given either blood or plasma \\nvolume expanders. They may later be given sympathomimetic agents for the \\nimprovement of tissue perfusion . \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nEither one or more mechan ism of action of sympathomimetic amines helps to \\nmaintain the perfusion of vital organs (brain, heart, and kidney), and other \\nvisceral organs:  \\n1) Increased Myocardial Contractility: Sympathomimetic amines increase  \\nthe cardiac output in case of adequate venou s return.

As a result of \\noverdosage, convulsions, cerebral haemorrhage , and tac hyarrhythmia resulting in \\nfatal ventricular arrhythmias are induced.  \\n \\nProlonged Administration of Vasoconstricting Sympathomimetic Amines:  \\nWhen  these agents  (especially , nor-adrenaline) are administered for a long time, \\na strong constriction of the post -capillary sphincter occurs due to decreased \\nplasma volume. As a result, the capillary pressure is increased , leading to loss of \\nfluids through the capillary walls. Also, a decrease in renal blood flow and \\nglomerular filtration rate is seen. Thus, a conditio n of marked tissue \\nhypoperfusion  and irreversible  shock usually results.  \\n \\nProlonged Administration of Large Doses of Nor -Adrenaline: When  large \\ndoses of nor -adrenaline are administered for a long time, necrosis of the \\nintestines, liver and kidneys, haemorr hage, focal myocarditis, intravascular \\nplatelet aggregation, and subepicardial haemorrhage  occur . \\n \\nIf the  sympathomimetic amines are suddenly withdrawn after a prolonged \\ntherapy , recurrent and profound hypotension  occurs; t hus, the therapy should  be \\ndiscon tinued gradually with appropriate fluid replacement.  \\n \\nExamples of Drugs  \\nNor-adrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, and the synthetic compounds like \\nisoprenaline, metaraminol , and dobutamine , are some of the sympathomimetic \\namines employed in the treatment of sh ock. Mephentermine, methoxamine, and \\nphenylephrine are the s ympathomimetic amines preferred as pressor agents \\nduring anaesthesia. Some of these drugs are discussed  below:  \\n1) Nor-Adrenaline:  It increases the perfusion pressure and cardiac output in \\npatients wi th shock who have very low peripheral vascular resistance. Hence, \\nit is employed in patients suffering from low peripheral resistance shock.  \\n \\nHowever, it should  not be administered in patients with shock syndrome, \\ncharacterised by high peripheral resistan ce and low or normal blood pressure . \\nThis is because in such patients, nor -adrenaline further induces \\nvasoconstriction , resulting in loss of plasma volume via capillaries and a \\nfurther worsening of kidney function.  \\n2) Adrenaline:  Administration of this drug  increases the cardiac output , \\ndecreases the renal blood flow , and increases t he Total Peripheral \\nResistance (TPR). Adrenaline is employed in the management of \\nanaphylactic shock.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 67}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='68 Pharmacology -II \\n*  * 3) Dopamine:  Renal and mesenteric blood flow is increased by this drug due to  \\nits action on dopamine receptors. Dopamine causes stimulation of the heart \\nvia activation of β-receptors. It increases the  cardiac output and renal blood \\nflow. It does not affect the  TPR. It successfully treats oliguric patients having  \\neither low or normal peripheral vascular resistance. Dopamine can also be \\ncombined with α-blocking age nt in a vas oconstricted patient . It is used in the \\ntreatment of cardiogenic, septic and traumatic shock.  \\n4) Isoprenaline: It exerts its action by a β-adrenergic activity. It acts on the \\nheart and the periphery. It does not cause vasoconstriction in the kidneys \\n(unlike adrenaline). It is helpful in patients with shock who have a high \\nperipheral vascular resistance.   \\n5) Metaraminol: Its haemodynamic actions are similar to those of nor -\\nadrenaline. However, its duration of action is longer than that of nor -\\nadrenaline.  \\n6) Dobutam ine: It is a  newly synt hesised synthetic catecholamine  that exerts \\nits actions by acting primarily on β 1-receptor s. It targets the cardiac β 1-\\nreceptors , and thus its action on β 2- and \\uf061-receptors are less pronounced. Its \\naction on \\uf061- and β 2-receptors of blood vessels are not much  efficient, and \\nthus have comparati vely fewer vascular effects.  \\n \\nDobutamine is employed in patients with severe CHF, and in those who have \\nundergone cardiac surgery as a short -term therapy. It increases the cardiac \\noutput as efficiently as is oprenaline. Its adverse effects  in the form of \\ntachycardia and arrhythmias are fewer as compared to those associated with \\nthe use of isoprenaline.  \\n \\n2.1.2.2.  α-Adrenoceptor Blocking Agents  \\nThe α -adrenoceptor blocking agents are used to reduce the intense vasoconstriction \\ncaused  by the reflex release of nor -adrenaline (from the adrenergi c nerves ) and \\ncatecholamines (from the adrenal medulla ) as a result of shock.  \\n  \\nAdvantages  of α-adrenoceptor blocking agents are:  \\n1) The harmful effect of vasoconstriction on microcirculation in tissues is avoided.  \\n2) Rapid administration of intravenous fluid is  enabled such that the central \\nvenous pressure is not increased.  \\n3) The occult plasma volume deficit is unmasked.  \\n \\nHowever, hypotension  may be seen as an adverse effect  of these agents,  \\nparticularly in patients with myocardial insufficiency. Therefore, therap y \\nconstituting \\uf061-blockers should  be followed by  adequate replacement of fluids. \\nThus, tissue perfusion is markedly improved.  \\n \\nThe most commonly employed α-adrenoceptor blocking agent is \\nphenoxybenzamine . It is a life -saving drug in patients with surgical shock or \\ntrauma.  It causes an intense re -distribution of blood flow and plasma volume. For \\nthis effect, it needs to be administered intravenously  in a dos e of 1mg/kg of body', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

Corticosteroids  \\nThe useful effects of corticosteroids in states of shock are not completely \\nunderstood. Their efficacy is also controversial. The sensitivity to endotoxin may \\nbe decreased when  corticosteroids are  adminis tered in cases of septic shock. \\nHowever, this increases the chances of infection, while increasing the probability \\nof bacteraemia. A high dose of corticosteroids are administered in a patient with \\nshock as they bring the following responses : \\n1) A positive ino tropic effect,  \\n2) Decreased peripheral resistance,  \\n3) Stabilisation of lysosomes,  \\n4) Preservation of integrity of small vessels, preventing leakage from \\nmicrocirculation, and  \\n5) Decreased adhesiveness of the platelets.  \\n \\nIt is suggested that microcirculation is improv ed by all these effects that account \\nfor a combination of increase in cardiac output, vasodilatation and protection of \\ncells from the damaging effects of proteases (by lysosomal membrane \\nstabilisation).  Although no suggestion relating to their advantageous  effects in \\npatients with shock has been reported. Yet, administration of corticosteroids in \\nlarge doses has been established to decrease the formation and liberation of \\ncardio -depressant elements from tissues due to their property of lysosomal \\nmembrane st abilisation. This property of corticosteroids also accounts for other \\ncellular effects that protect the cells from damage against hypoxia.  \\n \\n2.1.2.4.

In oliguric patients, the doses of cardiac glycosides should  be more \\nreduced to avoid cumul ative toxicity resulting from the ir accumulation.  \\n \\n2.1.2.6.  Glucagon  \\nMechanism of action of glucagon resembles  to that of sympathomimetic amines, \\nyet it is slightly different. It differs from the sympathomimetic  amines as its \\nactions are not blocked by β-blockers . \\n \\nAdvantages  of administering glucagon are:  \\n1) Increase in myocardial contractility and cardiac output, and  \\n2) Intravenous administration of 1 -2mg glucagon causes a definite improvement \\nin the hemodynamic status of patients with acute heart failure af ter a cardiac \\nsurgery and in patients of shock after myocardial infarction.  \\n \\nAdverse effects of using glucagon in patients with shock:  \\n1) Extreme nausea and vomiting (major effects), and  \\n2) Cardiac arrhythmias (rarely seen).  \\n \\n2.1.2.7.

Introduction  \\nThe word haemopoietic  relates to the blood making processes . Hematologic \\nsystem includes the blood and blood -forming organs. The main function of the \\nblood is transportation of oxygen and nutrients required by the cells and \\neliminatio n of wastes from the body. It also transports hormones released by \\nthe endocrine system. White blood cells are also required in prevention of \\ninfection.  \\n \\nThe blood is made up of two types of components , viz., plasma  which is a straw -\\ncoloured liquid (around  55%) and the formed elements  (other 45%)  which  \\ninclude erythrocytes  (red blood cells or RBCs), leukocytes  (white blood cells or \\nWBCs), and platelets  (clotting fragments).  \\n \\n2.2.2.  Hematinic s \\nHematinics  are involved in the formation of blood and  are u sed in the treatment \\nof anaemia  (a condition in which blood lacks healthy RBCs  or haemoglobin ). \\nHaemoglobin is a major part of the red blood cells to which oxygen molecules \\nget bound.  \\n \\nBody cells do not get sufficient amount of oxygen, if a n individ ual has a few or \\nabnormal red blood cells, or the haemoglobin level is low or abnormal. The main \\nsymptom of anaemia is fatigue which occurs if  organs do not get sufficient \\namount of oxygen that is required for different body functions.  \\n \\nAnaemia generally results from the deficiency of the following factors:  \\n1) Iron,  \\n2) Folic acid, and  \\n3) Vitamin B 12. \\n \\n2.2.2.1.  Iron  \\nA healthy adult human body contains around 3.5g m of iron , of which about 2/3rd \\nis found in the blood, whereas the remaining portion is  preserved as ferritin and \\nhemosiderin in the bone marrow, spleen and muscles. The iron released by the \\ndestruction of red blood cells (around 3 × 106 RBCs are destroyed every second) \\nis re -utilised for the production of haemoglobin. The healthy human adul t \\nrequires a diet containing around 10 -15mg iron per day.  \\n \\nSources  \\nMeat, chicken, egg yolk, liver, fish, oyster s, wheat germ, dry fruits, dry beans, \\nspinach, yeast, banana s, and apple s are the rich sources  of iron ; however, milk \\nand root vegetables have p oor amounts of  iron.

In other foods , iron is less \\navailable for absorption because it is bound to phytates or other complexing \\nagents. Non-haem iron and inorganic iron salts can be absorbed by intestinal \\nmucosal cells only after getting c onverted into ferrous iron.  \\n \\nFerrokinetics  \\nDepending on the physiological needs of the body, iron is absorbed  in the \\nduodenum and proximal jejunum via active transport mechanism.  Large doses of \\niron absorb  by diffusion across the mucosal barrier. In foodstuffs, iron is mostly \\npresent in ferric form , which is  reduced by the gastric acid to readily absorbable \\nferrous form . Due to this, achlorhydria reduces iron absorption , whereas  ascorb ic \\nacid (in high doses of 200mg in every 8 hour) being a reducing agent increases \\niron absorpt ion. \\n \\nThe ferrous iron reaches t he blood stream directly by passing through the mucosal \\ncell. It is bound to transferrin in the blood and is carried to the storage sites.  The \\nexcess ferrous iron in the mucosal cell is re -oxidised into the insoluble ferric state \\n(ferric  hydroxide phosphate  complex), which  forms ferritin (a complex ) by \\ncombining with apoferritin  (a protein ). \\n \\nFerritin is a storage form of iron. A mucosal barrier is formed  when the \\nmucosal cell cannot take up iron due to the saturation of apoferritin with iron. \\nMost of these mucosal cells are desquamated and lost in  the lumen of the gut. \\nTherefore, this mucosal barrier, called as ferritin curtain , controls iron \\nabsorption in the body . However, this mucosal barrier theory is still in question \\nby some workers.  \\n \\nIron (Fe3+) is re leased by ferritin into the blood stream, where iron binds to \\ntransferrin  (glycoprotein β1-globulin ). The resultant complex is  carried to the \\nstorage depots (liver, spleen, and bone marrow) and stored as ferritin  to be  \\nutilised for erythropoiesis. This iron is exchangeable, while the iron used  in the \\ncytochrome system is non -exchangeable. Trace amounts of iron are  excreted in \\nbile, urine, hair, nails , and sweat ; however, its excessive quantities are excreted \\nin the skin and gut through desquamation of ferritin -containing cells.  \\n \\nIron Therapy  \\nIn case of iron -deficiency anaemia, approximately 25 mg of iron is needed every \\nday for increasing haemoglobin by 1% per day. It is assumed that in oral therapy , \\nabout 30% of iron is absorbed , and therefore  it is necessary to administer around \\n180mg of elemental iron every day.  \\n \\nThe f ollowing iron preparati ons are given to treat anaemic condition s:  \\n1) Oral Iron Preparations:  It is the most common and preferred route for iron \\ntherapy.

The body \\nstores of folic acid are low; thus on stopping the intake of folic acid, the stores \\ndeplete and anaemia develops within 1 -6 months.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nFolic acid is an inactive biochemical compound that changes to te trahydrofolic \\nacid and methyltetrahydrofolate in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase  \\nenzyme .

Other than this it is also used to cure:  \\n1) Nutritional megaloblastic ana emia,  \\n2) Megaloblastic anaemia of pregnancy,  \\n3) Megaloblastic a naemia in infancy and childhood,  \\n4) Megaloblastic anaemia associated wi th alcoholism and liver disease,  \\n5) Chronic haemolytic states,  \\n6) Megaloblast ic anaemia of malignant disease, and  \\n7) Some cases of agranuloc ytosis.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nAdverse effects are very rare in injectable and oral preparations.

Vitamin B 12 (Cyanocobalamin)  \\nA wide range of both natural and semi -synthetic compounds are grouped in the \\ncobalamines family which include cyanocobalamin  (vitamin B 12) and \\nhydroxyc obalamin (vitamin B 12a).  Various other cobalamins are present , but they \\nare not as beneficial as vitamin B 12 and are also less stable . Vitamin B 12 is \\nprimarily used in the treatment of pernicious anaemia.  \\n \\nSources  \\nVitamin B 12 is one of the most important vitamins. In human s, it is formed by the \\ncolonic bacteria  (but is not absorbed)  and is excreted through faeces. Hence, the \\ndietary intake of vitamin B 12 is essential. In food, the cobalamins are found \\nbounded with protein and before absorption this bond is  broken by proteolysis.  \\nAround 0.6 -1.2µg/day of vitamin B 12 is required and it is mainly stored in the \\nliver. Total vitamin B 12 stored in the adults is around 5mg. It is naturally found in \\nanimal products, including  fish, meat,  poultry, eggs,  milk, and  milk products.   \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nIn the body vitamin B 12 is used in the following two forms : \\n1) Methylcobalamin: This form of vitamin B 12 is used as a cofactor by \\nmethionine synthase enzyme , which is involved in the conversion of \\nhomocysteine into methionine  (required in DNA methylation ). In tissues , \\nvitamin B 12 changes to coenzyme B 12 (methylcobalamin ), which i s needed \\nfor the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate and for the synthesis of \\nmethionine from homocysteine (a reaction in which folate is also r equired).  \\nVitamin B 12 also regulates sulfhydryl (S H) groups in the reduced form \\nrequired by various SH -activated enzyme systems.  \\n2) 5-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin: It acts as a cofactor for L -methylmalonyl -CoA \\nmutase enzyme, which changes L -methylmalonyl -CoA to suc cinyl -CoA. \\nThis conversion is essential for the extraction of energy from proteins and \\nfats. Succinyl CoA is also required for the production of haemoglobin.  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nFood contains vitamin B 12 as protein conjugates. Free vitamin B 12 is released in  \\nthe stomach and duodenum by gastric acid and proteolytic enzymes. It  is also \\nreleased by cooking food. Intrinsic factor (a specific glycoprotein) is secreted by \\nthe parietal cells of stomach.

Pernicious \\nanaemia  is a type of megaloblastic anaemia which occurs due to vitamin B 12 \\ndeficiency in the absence o f castle intrinsic factor  (secreted by the normal \\ngastric mucosa ). This intrinsic factor is required for the intestinal absorption \\nof the extrinsic factor, i.e.,  dietary vitamin B 12.  \\n \\nVitamin B 12 deficiency mainly occurs due to ineffective haemopoiesis \\n(maturation arrest at the megaloblastic stage) , inadequate epithelial cells of \\nthe gut (histamine -fast achlorhydria and achylia gastric a), inadequate myelin \\nsynthe sis (sub -acute combined degeneration of the dorsal columns of the \\nspinal cord)  and general debility.  \\n2) Neurological  Disorders: Neurological symptoms of vitamin B 12 deficiency \\nare paraesthesias of hand and feet, reduction on the sen sation of vibration and \\nposition, reduced deep tendon reflexes,  memory l oss, confusion, delusion, \\nloss of central vision, hallucination, and psy chosis.  \\n \\nPreparations and Dosage  \\nVitamin B 12 is available as tablet s, syrup s, and injectable s along with other \\nvitamins.

Vitamin K  \\nVitamin K takes part in blood coagulation reaction , and therefore is indicated in \\nthe treatment of haemorrhages. Whole blood o r plasma is best for the immediate \\neffects as it provides all the endogenous coagulation factors along with plasma \\nvolume replenishment. Vitamin K is fat -soluble vitamin which takes part in the \\nsynthesis of clotting factors.  \\n \\nSources  \\nGreen leafy vegetables , liver, cheese, butter, and egg yolk are good sources of \\nvitamin K.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nVitamin K is required for the synthesis of various factors II, VII, IX, and X that \\ntake part in blood coagulation reaction. Chemically, these factors are \\nglycoprotei ns with a number (10 or 11) or \\uf067-carboxyglutamic acid at the ─NH 2 \\nterminal of the peptide chains.

For the treatment of this condition , vitamin K \\npreparations are given through oral rou te. \\n2) Obstructive Jaundice:  It is caused by malabsorption of dietary or intestinal \\nvitamin K. Vitamin K 3 can be administered orally, while  K1 or K 2 can be \\ngiven th rough parenteral route.  \\n3) Overdosage of Oral Anticoagulants:  In this case, vitamin K is given as \\nspecific antidote. Vitamin K 1 is the preparation of choice due to its rapid \\nonset of action.

Large doses \\nof synthetic menadione may cause haemolytic anaemia , hyper bilirubinemia and \\nkernicterus in new -borns, mainly in premature infants.  \\n \\nPreparations  \\n1) Phytomenadione (Phytonadione, Vitamin K 1): It is a naturally found \\nvitamin and works within 12 hours. It can be given through IV, IM, SC , and \\noral route s. It shou ld be given slowly  in case of intravenous administration as \\nflushing, sweating, chest tightness, and peripheral vascu lar collapse may \\noccur due to the presence of castor oil in the preparation.  \\n2) Menadione Sodium Diphosphate (Vitamin K 3): It is a  water -soluble, \\nsynthe tic analogue of vitamin K given daily in 5 -40mg dose by IV, IM, and \\noral route .

It is used in \\nsurgery along with thrombin. Fibrin foam dipped in thrombin is kept at the \\nbleeding site and can be left in place as the clotting material of human origin.  \\n6) Snake Venoms:  Venom of the Russell’s viper and copper head snake is used \\nas coagulant s. The venom increases coagulation by activating \\nthrombokinase. It can be u sed systemically or locally.  \\n7) Oxidised Cellulose (Oxycel):  It is a dry absorbable surgical gauze. It is used \\nin haemostasis and helps in clotting by reaction between haemo globin and \\ncellulosic acid.

This reduced vitamin K is oxidised to vitamin K epoxide (inactive \\nform). This reaction is coupled with pr otein carboxylation by which Des Carboxy \\nProthrombin (DCP) is converted to prothrombin by carboxylation of glutamate \\nresidue.  By the reactions of enzyme, vitamin K hydroquinone is regenerated from \\nvitamin K -epoxide, using NADH as a co -factor.

However, \\ncurrently it is  derived as a product of recombinant DNA technology.  It is \\nadministered in 0.9mg/kg of dose as it has a v ery short half -life (5 -30 \\nminutes). 10% of this dose is injected intravenously as a bolus and the \\nremaining is administered over 60 minutes.      \\nEven with a low affinity for free plasminogen in the plasma, alteplase rapidly \\nactivates plasminogen bound to fibrin in a thrombus or haemostatic plug. \\nTherefore, alteplase is fibrin selective .

Alteplase is used for \\ntreating myocardial infarction, massive pulmonary embolism, a nd acute \\nischemic stroke.

It directly \\nactivates plasminogen and has a plasma half-life of 10 -15 minutes.

Anti -Platelet Drugs  \\nAnti-platelet  or anti -thrombotic drugs affect  platelet plug formation and are \\nmainly used for preventing arterial thromboembolism.  \\nCombination of anti -platelet drugs produces additive or synergistic effect. These \\nproperties are used for preventing restenosis af ter coronary angioplasty and \\ncoronary stenting.  \\n \\n2.2.6.1.  Classification  \\nAnti-platelet drugs based on their mechanism of action  are classified as  follows : \\n1) Prostaglandin Synthesis (PG) Inhibitors:  Aspirin  and Dazoxiben . \\n2) Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Dipyridamole.  \\n3) ADP-Induced Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors: Ticlopidine and  \\nClopidogrel.  \\n4) Glycoprotein II b/III a Receptor Inhibitors : Tirofiban and Eptifibatide . \\n \\n2.2.6.2.  Prostaglandin Synthesis (PG) Inhibitors  \\nSome common PG inhibitors are discussed below:  \\n1) Aspirin: In low doses (75 -300mg/day), it is  used as a prophylaxis of \\nmyocardial infarction and also as a prophylaxis against secondary myocardial \\ninfarction . Aspirin  acts through  irreversible  acetyla tion of plat elet \\ncyclooxygenase.  In low doses, it produces a  nominal and transient effect on \\nvascular cyclooxygenase. It has been proved that aspirin in low doses \\nreduces the occurrence  of non -fatal myocardial infarction and re -infarction; \\nhowever, t he overall mortali ty rate is left  unaffected. Scientifically , low \\ndoses of aspirin can be used for long -term prevention of  myocardial \\ninfarction. Its effects can be improved  by using it  along  with dipyridamole.  \\n2) Dazoxiben: It is a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, thus sele ctively \\ndecreases TxA 2. It does not inhibit platelet aggregation  when given alone; \\nhowever,  with aspirin it produces  considerable effects.  \\n3) Epoprostenol (PGI 2): It is a potent inh ibitor of platelet aggregation; but its \\nuse has been  prohibited  due to its ve ry short half-life. It may be used during \\nrenal dialysis or cardiac bypass surgery.  \\n4) Sulphinpyrazone: It is a uricosuric drug and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. It \\nis not selective for platelets. Earlier it was used in low doses to prevent \\nmyocardial re -infar ction  (like aspirin) , but after multi -centric long -term \\ntrials, it  has been withdrawn.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors  \\nPhosphodiesterase inhibitors inhibit  platelet function by inhibiting cGMP \\nphosphodiesterase a ctivity and/or adenosine uptake. It is never used alone  due to \\nits minimal antiplatelet action, thus is used along with aspirin to enhance the  \\nantiplatelet action.  In secondary prophylaxis of cerebrovascular diseases, \\ndipyridamole is used along with  aspiri n. Dipyridamole with warfarin is used after \\nprosthetic heart valve surgery for primary prophylaxis of thromboembolism.  \\n \\n2.2.6.4.  ADP -Induced Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors  \\nThe commonly used drugs that inhibit  platelet aggregation are  discussed below : \\n1) Dipyridamole:  It inhibits phosphodiesterase for increasing platelet cAMP . It \\ncan also release PG precursors from vascular endothelium. It is a vasodilator \\nand can inhibit platelet adhesion to thr ombogenic surfaces. It can be used \\nalong  with low -dose aspirin.  \\n2) Timolol:  It is a β-adrenoceptor blocker , and its concurrent use synergises the \\naction of low -dose aspirin. It is used for long -term prevention of  secondary \\nmyocardial infarction . \\n3) Clopidogrel and Ticlopidine:  These drugs inhibit the ADP pathway of \\nthrombocytes , and thus reduce platelet aggregation. The binding of ADP to \\nits receptors is inhibited irreversibly by these drugs. They do not inhibit \\nprostaglandin synthesis. Clinically, they are used for treating unstable angina \\npectoris, acute coronary syndrome, acute neurovascul ar disease, peripheral \\nvascular disease , and for preventing thrombosis coronary surgery. The dose \\nof ticlopidine is 250mg twice  daily via oral route , and that of clopidogrel is \\n75mg/day, with a subsequent loading dose of 300mg via oral route . Nearly \\n80% pl atelet activity is inhibited by these doses. Gastrointestinal adverse \\neffects , leucopenia , and haemorrhage  are the adverse effects of ticlopidine , \\nwhereas clopidogrel may cause haemorrhage. Because of less adverse effects \\nand the dosage factor, clopidogrel  is preferred over ticlopidine.  \\n4) Clofibrate:  It is a hypolipidaemic drug which may be used for reducing \\nplatelet adhesiveness. It does not prevent secondary myocardial infarction . \\n5) Dextran -70 and  Dextran -75: These are plasma volume expanders given as \\nIV infu sions. They have  no effect on platelet function in vitro , but damages \\nplatelet function and fibrin polymerisation in vivo . Postoperatively, they are \\nused for preventing venous thrombosis.  \\n \\n2.2.6.5.  Glycoprotein II b/III a Receptor Inhibitors  \\nGlycoprotein II b/III a receptor inhibitors are integrin or platelet surface adhesive  \\nreceptors . The receptor complex binds fibronectin and Von Willebrand  factor, \\nand also functions as a receptor for fibrinogen and vitronectin. The receptor', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

The effect of other \\nplatelet agonist s (e.g., collagen, thrombin, TXA 2, ADP, etc. ) is inhibited by \\nGPII b/III a receptor inhibitors. They also inhibit the final common pathway for \\nplatelet aggregation.  \\n \\nGPII b/III a receptors including vitronectin receptor are blocked by abciximab  (a \\nhumanised monoclonal antibody ). Eptifibatide  and Tirofiban  (chemical \\nanalogues of fibrinogen)  block  fibrinogen binding.  These drugs are parenterally \\nadministered as a short course therapy in percutaneous coronary intervention and \\nacute coronary syndrome.  \\n \\n2.2.6.6.  Mechanism of Action  \\nAntiplatelet agents affect various pla telet functions , such as aggregation, release \\nof granule contents, and platelet -mediated vascular constriction. The mechanisms \\nof action of different classes of anti -platelets are  given below : \\n1) Class I:  Irreversible  cyclooxygenase ( or prostaglandin H syntha se) is  the \\nenzyme mediating the first step in prostaglandin and thromboxane \\nbiosynthesis from arachidonic acid. This enzyme is blocked by as pirin and \\nrelated compounds (NSAIDs  and sulfinpyrazone).  \\n2) Class II:  Dipyridamole inhibits cAMP breakdown mediated by \\nphosphodiesterase, thus prevents platelet activation by multiple mechanisms.  \\n3) Class III:  Ticlopidine and clopidogrel block  the binding of ADP to a low -\\naffinity, type -2 purinergic receptor and prevent  the activation of GPII b/III a \\nreceptor complex , thus subsequent aggregation.  \\n4) Class IV:  The final common pathway of platelet aggregation is inhibited by \\nanti-IIb/III a antibodies (abciximab) and receptor antagonists (tirofiban and  \\neptifibatide). They may also prevent the initial adhesion to the vessel wall.  \\n \\n2.2.6.7.  Thera peutic Uses  \\nAnti-platelet drugs prevent arterial thromboembolism in the following situations:  \\n1) Coronary Artery Diseases  \\ni) Unstable Angina: The risk of death and myocardial in farction is reduced \\nby aspirin in 75-325mg/day dose . However, aspirin along with  \\nclopidogrel (75mg/day) is preferred . Abciximab via intravenous route \\ndue to its rapid action is used as a short -term therapy  for the same \\npurpose. Maintenance therapy is given  for an indefinite period by oral \\naspirin or clopidogrel in 75mg/day dose . \\nii) Acute Myoc ardial Infarction:  Survival (30% reduction in mortality) \\nand thrombolytic therapy is improved by oral aspirin in 325mg  dose (1 \\ntablet)  followed by a maintenance dose of 75mg /day. \\niii) Post MI Patients:  Aspirin in 75mg/day dose  is administered  for an \\nundefined p eriod as a secondary prophylactic agent for reducing the risk \\nof infarction  by 25%.

Aspirin is not a drug  of choice in combination \\nwith warfarin due to the adverse drug reactions  that may occur . \\n4) Venous Thromboembolism:  Anticoagulants are used to prevent venous \\nthromboembolism, while  anti-platelet drugs are unimportant.  \\n \\n2.2.6.8.  Adverse Effects  \\nThe adverse effects of anti-platelet drugs include s tomach upset,  heartburn,  \\nnausea,  constipation,  flushing,  dizziness,  weakness,  headache,  bloody stools,  GI \\nbleeding,  rashes,  liver impairment, and  anaphylactic shock.  \\n \\n2.2.7.  Plasma Volume Expanders  \\nPlasma volume expand ers are the colloidal solutions  used to control the blood \\nvolume temporarily in critical conditions. Colloidal solutions with smaller size \\nparticle and lower molecular weight apply a greater oncotic pressure  (or colloid \\nosmotic pressure ). Conditions of an  ideal plasma volume expander  are given \\nas follows:  \\n1) The oncotic pressure, pH , and viscosity of the solution should be similar to \\nplasma.  \\n2) It should be retained in the circulation for a sufficient duration.  \\n3) It should be non -pyrogenic and non -antigenic.  \\n4) It should be stable and inexpensive.  \\n5) It should not inhibit blood grouping and cross matching of blood.  \\n \\n2.2.7.1.  Classification  \\nFollowing are the important plasma volume expanders:  \\n1) Human albumin,  \\n2) Dextran,  \\n3) Polyvinylpyrrolidone,  \\n4) Hetastarch,  \\n5) Degraded gela tin polymer.  \\n \\n2.2.7.2.  Human Albumin  \\nAlbumin and plasma protein fraction are obtained from pooled human plasma. \\nThey are the commonly  used plasma expanders and are rich protein molecules not \\nhaving any risk of hepatitis.  Around 25g m of 5% albumin is osmotically eq ual to \\nabout 500ml of fresh frozen plasma. Plasma protein fraction also has globulin with \\nalbumin. Plasma substitutes li ke dextran, hetastarch, gelatin , etc., can be used in \\ncase hu man albumin is not available. Albumin temporarily   increases the blood \\nvolume , which  further  decreases haemoglobin concentration and blood viscosity.  \\nHuman albumin  is used for the treatment of severe blood loss, hypervolemia, and \\nhypoproteinemia.

Dextran -40 \\nDextran -40 is a glucose polymer having molecular weight of 40,000. In the form \\nof 10% solution, it exerts high osm otic pressure than plasma proteins. Hence, it \\nforms a greater expansion of plasma volume than dextran of higher molecular \\nweight , while the expansion can have smaller period of action due to more fast \\nrenal excretion.  Dextran -40 is primarily used for the t reatment of shock, \\ncerebrovascular accidents, foetal distress syndrome, prevention of peritoneal \\nadhesions, and burns.  Sometimes, dextran infusions may cause hypersensitivity \\nreactions like fever, nasal congestion, joint pains, urticaria, hypotension, and \\nbronchospasm. Severe anaphylactic reactions are very uncommon and can be \\nfatal. Nausea and vomiting can also occur. After discontinuing  dextran, these \\nsymptoms can be treated symptomatically.  \\n \\n2.2.7.4.  Dextran -70 \\nDextran -70 is a glucose polymer having molecular wei ght of 70,000. It is formed \\nby sucrose fermentation, just like d extran -40. Dextran -70 as a 6% solution \\napplies a colloidal osmotic pressure same as plasma protein. Therefore, it is used \\nfor short -term expansion of the plasma volume in situations like shock  or \\nimpending shock occurs due to burns, surgery, haemorrhage or trauma. It also \\ninhibits the post -operative thromboembolic disorders.   \\n \\nThe adverse effects of dextran -70 are similar as d extran -40. Dextran -70 infusions \\nare contraindicated in patients with severe CHF, bleeding disorders (like \\nhypofibrinogenemia or thrombocytopenia), and renal failure. Heparin \\nanticoagulant effect can be improved by dextran.  Its higher molecular weight \\ninhibits the blood group and cross matching of blood. The presence of dext ran \\ncan affect the determination of glucose, bilirubin, or proteins in blood or urine.  \\n \\n2.2.7.5.  Polyvinylpyrrolidone  \\nPolyvinylpyrrolidone is a synthetic polymer that affects the blood grouping and \\ncross matching of blood. It binds with insulin and penicillin in ci rculation and \\ndecreases their effect.  \\n \\n2.2.7.6.  Hetastarch (Hydroxyethyl Starch)  \\nHetastarch contains  more th an 90% of amylopectin and has an average molecular \\nweight of 4,50,000. It has a different plasma retention and volume effect. Its 6% \\niso-oncotic infusion sol ution permits blood volume regulation and an effective \\nstabilisation of blood volume. It applies same colloidal osmotic pressure as \\nhuman alb umin and this effect lasts for 24-36 hours.  Hetastarch is used for short -\\nterm expansion of the plasma volume i n sho ck or impending shock that may \\nresult from  burns, surgery, haemorrhage, or trauma.

Medium Efficacy Diuretics  (Thiazid es and Thiazide -\\nLike  Drugs ) \\nThiazide diuretics are referred to as moderately efficacious diuretics  as a \\nmajor ity (nearly 90%) of the filtered sodium is already re -absorbed even before it \\nreaches the distal tubule.  They comprise of two distinct groups of diuretics:  \\n1) Thiazide: These d iuretics , e.g., chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, \\npolythiazide, etc., contain a benzothiadiazine ring.   \\n2) Thiazide -Like: These diuretics, e.g., chlorthalidone, indapamide, \\nmetolazone, etc., do not contain benzothiadiazine ring , but an un -substituted \\nsulphonamide group.  \\n \\nThe most commonly used thiazide  is chlorothiazide . \\n \\n3.1.4.1.  Mechanism of Ac tion \\nThiazide diuretics act by blocking the Na+/Cl– co-transport system  and exert their \\nactions on the distal convoluted tubules  (figure 3.2). Carbonic anhydrase activity \\nis also inhibited by these drugs and they increase the excretion of bicarbonate \\nions, Mg+ and K+.

The organic \\nacid secretory system excretes these agents in the proximal tubule of kidneys. \\nThey inhibit the excretion of uric acid resulting in hyperuricaemia . Onset of \\naction generally occurs in  1-2 hours, with the maximal effect occurring in 4 -6 \\nhours. T he action lasts for 8-12 hours.  \\n \\nActions of bendroflumethiazide  last for 24 hours.  The duration of action of \\nchlorthalidone  is 48-72 hours as it undergoes slow absorption. The medium \\nefficacy diuretics differ from each other only in the onset and duration of action. \\nThe mechanism of action of all the drugs in this group is similar , thus resistance \\nto any one compound in this group makes the other drugs of this group also \\nresistant for that pati ent. Moreover, beyond an acceptable  limit, the actions of \\nthis g roup of drugs do not depend on the dosage administered.  \\n \\n3.1.4.3.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nMedium efficacy diuretics have the following therapeutic uses:  \\n1) Oedema:  Cardiac, hepatic and renal oedema associated with chronic heart \\nfailure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, chronic  renal failure , and \\nglomerulonephritis can be successfully treated using thiazides. However, \\nwhen the GFR falls below 30ml/min, thiazides are not effective. These \\nagents cannot be employed in the trea tment of acute pulmonary oedema . \\n2) Hypertension:  It can be  effectively treated using thiazides. In the elderly and \\nobese patients, thiazides alone (as monotherapy) are useful in the treatment \\nof mild hypertension. For the treatment of moderate and severe hypertension, \\nthey are  employed as a combinational therapy along with other anti -\\nhypertensives.  \\n \\nAdvantages of thiazides as anti -hypertensives include:  \\ni) Low-cost, good efficiency and tolerability, decreased cardiovascular \\nmorbidity and mortality,  \\nii) Effective even when administered once a day,  \\niii) Shows better patient co mpliance,  and \\niv) Additive or synergistic effect with other anti -hypertensive agents.  \\n3) Calcium Nephrolithiasis:  Calcium re -absorption is increased by the use of \\nthiazides by the following two mechanisms:  \\ni) Increase d re-absorption in the proximal tubule due to vol ume depletion.  \\nii) Direct increase in Ca2+ ion re-absorption in the distal convoluted tubule.  \\nThus, the excretion of Ca2+ ions i n urine is increased by the action of \\nthiazides , and hence these agents effectively treat calcium nephrolithiasis.  \\n4) Diabetes Insipidu s: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is primarily treated \\nusing thiazides. Upto 50% of urine volume is decreased by the action of \\nthiazides. They act  possibly by the following mechanisms:  \\ni) They promote complete re -absorption of water in the proximal tubule by \\nvolume depletion . \\nii) They  increase the sensitivity of the collecting tubules to ADH.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 98}),\n",

Thus, bromine \\nintoxication may be treated us ing thiazides.  \\n \\n3.1.4.4.  Adverse Effects  \\nThough the safety margin of thiazides is wide and the toxic effects are very rare, \\nyet, in some conditions the following adverse effects may be seen:  \\n1) Electrolyte disturbances may be seen in the form of hyponatremic, \\nhypochlo remic metabolic alkalosis together with hypokalaemia and may \\nmanifest as weakness, fatigability, and paraesthesia.  \\n2) In patients susceptible to diabetes mellitus, the suppression of insulin release \\nfrom the pancreas may exacerbate glycosuria and hyperglycaem ia. \\n3) Inhibition of uric acid secretion in proximal renal tubules causes decreased \\nurinary excretion of uric acid, which may cause hyperuricemia. This \\ncondition may act as a precipitating factor for an acute attack of gout in \\npatients susceptible to it.  \\n4) Admi nistration of high doses of thiazides may result in reversible \\nhyperlipidaemia (increas e in serum cholesterol and LDL) . \\n5) In some patients, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.  \\n6) Thiazides decrease the renal excretion of ammonia , and thus  can precipitate \\nhepa tic encephalopathy in patients with hepatic insufficiency.  \\n \\n3.1.4.5.  Drug Interactions  \\nDrug interactions of thiazide diuretics include:  \\n1) They  increase the potency of  other anti -hypertensive agents, and this \\nproperty of thiazides is used therapeutically.  \\n2) They  induce hypokalaemia, which in turn brings about the following effects:  \\ni) Increases digitalis toxicity,  \\nii) Increases the chances of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia resulting \\nfrom quinidine and other anti -arrhythmic agents used,  and \\niii) Increases the potency of neurom uscular blockers and decreases the \\naction of sulphonylureas.  \\n3) The use of cotrimoxazole along with diuretics increases the prevalence of \\nthrombocytopenia.  \\n4) NSAIDs reduce anti -hypertensive activity of thiazides and furosemide.  \\n5) The tubular secretion of thiazid es is compet itively inhibited by probenecid, \\nwhich  decreases the action of thiazide by reducing the concentration in the \\ntubular fluid. On the other hand, the uricosuric action of probenecid is \\ndiminished by probenecid.  \\n6) Patients undergoing diuretic therapy  show an increase in the serum level of \\nlithium due to increased reabsorption of Li+ ions (and Na+ ions)  in the \\nproximal tubule .  \\n \\n3.1.4.6.  Contraindications  \\nIn patients sensitive to sulpha  drugs, thiazide diuretics should  be used cautiously. \\nIf possible, these dru gs should be avoided in such patients.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 99}),\n",

Mechanism of Action  \\nThe m echanism of action of each class of weak diuretics is  given below : \\n1) Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: Acetazolamide inhibit s carbo nic \\nanhydrase enzyme, thus prevent the  formation of H+ ions. As a result, the \\nexchange of Na+/H+ ions does not take place. The Na+ ions are  excreted in the \\nurine along with\\n\\uf02d\\n3 HCO ions ( figure 3.3). In the distal convoluted tubule,  \\nincreased Na+/K+ exchange leads to loss of K+ ions.

The \\nNa+ ion channel present in the luminal membrane of the principal cells \\nprovides pathway for the entry of Na+ ions into the ce lls, down the \\nelectrochemical gradient. This electrochemical gradient is created by the \\nbasolateral Na+ pump. The luminal membrane is highly permeable to Na+ \\nions,  thereby creating a lumen negative trans -epithelial potential difference. \\nThis potential diff erence provides an important driving force enabling the \\nsecretion of K+ ions into the lumen  (figure 3.4). \\n \\nThe H+ is secreted into the tubular lumen by the intercalated cells. This \\nsecretion occurs by the H+-ATPase pump or proton pump (figure 3.4) and the \\nlumen negative trans -epithelial voltage difference that acts as the driving force. \\nThe potassium sparing diuretics (amiloride and triamterene) block the Na+ ion \\nchannels in the luminal membrane of the principal cells in the late distal tubule \\nand collectin g duct.

It is synthesised \\nin the form of a large p recursor peptid e together with its binding protein \\n(neurophysin) . It is transported along the axons to the nerve endings in the \\nmedian eminence and pars nervosa. Its secretion occurs via posterior pituitary \\n(neurohypophysis), together with oxytocin.  \\n \\nThe rate of ADH release is regulated by the receptors present in left atrium, \\nventricles and pulmonary veins , and by osmoreceptors present in the \\nhypothalamus. Hydration of body governs ADH release , which is also affected \\nby impulses from baroreceptors and higher centres in the brain. An increase in \\nthe osmolarity of plasma and contraction of ECF volume form the two main \\nphysiological stimuli for ADH release. Angiotensin II, Prostaglandins ( PGs), \\nhistamine, neuropeptide Y, and ACh increase ADH secretion. On the other hand, \\nADH secretion is inhibited by GABA and Atrial Natriuretic Peptides (ANP). \\nAgent -specific action is seen by opioids; endogenous opioid peptides usually \\ninhibit ADH secretion, while morphine stimulates its secretion.  \\n \\nADH  present in mammals is termed 8-Argini ne-Vasopressin  (AVP).

ADH (Vasopressin) Receptor  \\nVasopr essin receptors are G -protein coupled cell -membrane receptors. T he \\nfollowing t wo sub -types of vasopressin  receptors have been identified : \\n1) V1 Receptors:  All vasopressin receptors are of V1 type, excluding the ones \\non the cells of the Collecting Duct in the kidneys and a few blood vessels. \\nFurther, the V 1 receptors are divided into:  \\ni) V1a Receptors:  Located on the vascular and other smooth muscles, \\nplatelets, liver, etc .  \\nii) V1b Receptors:  Located on the anterior pituitary.  \\n \\nThe V 1 receptors act via phospholipase  C-IP3/DAG pathway. They release \\nCa2+ ions and result  in vasoconstriction, visceral smooth muscle contraction, \\nglycogenolysis, platelet aggregation, ACTH release, etc.  \\n2) V2 Receptors:  These receptors are present on the cells of the Collecting Duct \\n(CD) in t he kidney s. Blood vessels form the site of occurrence for the \\nvasodilatory V 2 receptors. The water permeability of these receptors is \\nregulated via cAMP production. ADH is more sensitive to V 2 receptors as \\ncompared to the V 1 receptors.  \\n \\n3.2.3.2.  Vasopressin Analogu es \\nThe vasopressin analogues used as antidiuretics are:  \\n1) Lypressin:  It is an analogue o f 8-lysine vasopressin. It is less potent than \\nAVP.

It is a prodrug for \\nvasopressin analogues. It is employed in the treatment of bleeding \\noesophageal varices. Its a dverse effects are less severe as compared to thos e \\nproduced by lypressin.  \\n3) Desmopressin (dDAVP): It is a synthetic peptide of vasopressin. It exerts a \\nselective V 2 agonistic activity. Its potency as an antidiuretic is 12 times more \\nthan that of AVP. Its vasoconstrictor action is negligible. Its e nzymatic \\ndegradation is relatively slower , and therefore the duration of action is more.  \\n \\nHalf-life of desmopressin  is 1-2 hours and duration of action is 8 -12 hours. It \\nis employed for the actions mediated by V 2 receptors. The preferred route of \\nits administratio n is intranasal, although its bioavailability by this route is \\nonly 10 -20%.  \\n \\nAn oral formulation of desmopressin has been marketed in the recent past. \\nThough the dosage of this oral formulation is 10 -15 times more than that of \\nthe intranasal formulation, yet it is advantageous since the nasal and systemic \\nside effects can be avoided by this route. Bioavailabili ty of this oral \\nformulation is 1-2%. In a majority of patients, oral tablets are consumed \\nmore conveniently than the intranasal spray.  \\n \\n3.2.3.3.  Mechanism of  Action  \\nThe V2 sub-receptors  are present on the basolateral side of the cell membrane of \\ncollecting duct. These receptors on activation  increase the cAMP formation \\nintracellularly; this further result  in the activation of cAMP -dependent protein \\nkinase A.  \\n \\nIntracellular cAMP formation increases with an increase in the activation of V2 \\nreceptors . Hence, the activation of cAMP -dependent protein kinase A increases \\nand the relevant proteins are phosphor ylated, which in turn stimulate  the \\nexocyto sis of aquaporin -2 [a Water Channel Containing Vesicle (WCV )] via \\napical membrane. Thus, within the apical membrane, the insertion of aqueous \\nchannels increases.  \\n \\nEndocytosis and degradation rates of WCVs decrease simultaneously. In the \\napical membrane, water permeabilit y through the cells of  collecting duct  \\nincreases  in relation to the population of aquaporin -2 channels, at any given time. \\nIn addition to this, stimulation of V 2 receptors continually (during chronic water \\ndeprivation) results in an up -regulation of the sy nthesis of aquaporin -2 through \\nthe cAMP response element of the gene that encodes aquaporin -2. \\n \\nAquaporin -1 (in proximal tubule) and aquaporin -3 and -4 (on basolateral \\nmembrane of the cells of collecting duct ) also help in the transport of water at \\ntheir r espective sites.  Response of the kidneys to ADH is also shown by the V1 \\nreceptors , which include:  \\n1) The V1a receptors on activation cause  constriction of vasa recta. As a result, \\nthe inner medulla receives a decreased blood flow and this helps to maintain \\na high osmolarity in this area, thereby contributing to anti -diuresis.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 107}),\n",

Pharmacokinetics  \\nTrypsin destructs AVP , therefore is orally inactive. It should  be administered either \\nby a parenteral route or by intranasal route. Rapid enzymatic cleavage of the \\npeptide chain of AVP occurs in many organs , particularly in the liver and kidneys. \\nThe plasma half -life of AVP administered as a drug is s hort (approximately 25 \\nminutes). The a ctivity of aqueous vasopressin lasts only for 3 -4 hours.  \\n \\n3.2.3.5.  Pharmacological Actions  \\nThe p harmacological actions of antidiure tic drugs are  given below : \\n1) Kidney: Permeability to water in the cells  of collecting duct  is increased by \\nthe action of AVP. This means that equilibrium is achieved with the renal \\nmedulla (in which the osmolarity is more) , and thus water diffuses from the \\nlumen into the interstitium. In the absence of ADH, the cells of collecting duct \\nare not permeable to water. As a result, dilute urine is formed (since it is \\npassed as produced by the diluting segment). When the concentration of ADH \\ndecreases, a graded effe ct is seen and the volume of urine strictly balances the \\nintake of fluids.  \\n2) Blood Vessels: AVP acts on V 1 receptors to constrict the blood vessels, thus \\nincreasing BP. Therefore it is also termed as vasopressin. However, this effect \\nis achieved only at a mu ch larger concentration of AVP than that required to \\nproduce the anti -diuretic effect. Action of AVP is thus not physiologically \\nsignificant. Constriction is seen in the cutaneous, mesenteric, skeletal muscle, \\nfat depot, thyroid, and coronary beds.  \\n3) Other A ctions: The anti -diuretics cause contraction of most of the other \\nvisceral smooth muscles. They may also increase peristalsis in gut (especially \\nlarge bowel), evacuation and expulsion of gases:  \\ni) Uterus: AVP acts on oxytocin receptors resulting in uterus co ntraction. \\nThe potency of AVP is same as that of oxytocin in a non -pregnant uterus \\nand in an early pregnancy uterus.  \\nii) CNS: When administered exogenously, AVP does not cross the blood -\\nbrain barrier. At present, AVP has been known as a peptide \\nneurotransmitte r in several areas of the brain and spinal cord, which may \\nbe involved in the regulation of temperature, circulation, ACTH release, \\nand in learning various tasks.  \\n \\nPlatelet aggregatio n and hepatic glycogenolysis have  been induced by \\nAVP. Coagulation factor  VIII and von Willebrand’s factor has been found \\nto be released by AVP from the vascular endothelium via V 2 receptors.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 108}),\n",

Therapeutic Uses  \\nThe therapeutic uses of v asopressin analogues are as follows:  \\n1) Based on V 1 Actions  \\ni) Bleeding Esophageal Varices:  Vasopres sin/terlipressin constricts \\nmesenteric blood vessels and decreases the blood flow from liver to the \\nvarices, thereby allowing a clot to form. Thus, these agents help stop \\nbleeding.   \\nii) Before Abdominal Radiography: AVP/lypressin is sometimes \\nemployed to make the bowel free of gases.  \\n2) Based on V 2 Actions (Desmopressin is the Drug of Choice)  \\ni) Diabetes Insipidus:  The most significant use of vasopressin analogue is \\nin neurogenic diabetes insipidus . In renal diabetes insipidus , these agents \\nare not as effective as th e kidneys do not respond to ADH. Except in a \\nfew patients where DI occurs transiently ( e.g., those with head injury or \\nneurosurgery), vasopressin therapy is required throughout the life.  \\nii) Bedwetting in Children and Nocturia in Adults:  Administration of \\ndeco mpression eit her by intranasal or oral route  at bed time reduces the \\nvolume of urine and thus helps in control ling primary nocturia.  \\niii) Renal Concentration Test : Concentration of urine is maximum when 5 -\\n10U of aqueous vasopressin (im ) or 2µg of desmopressin is administered.  \\niv) Haemophilia and  von Willebrand’s Disease:  AVP  releases coagulation \\nfactor VIII and von Willebrand’s factor , therefore checks bleeding. The \\npreferred drug of choice for this disease is desmopressin, administered in \\na dose of 0.3µg/kg dilute d in 50ml saline and infused IV over 30  minutes. \\n \\n3.2.3.7.  Adverse Effects  \\nDesmopressin selectively acts onV 2 receptors , and thus shows lesser adverse \\neffects as compared to vasopressin, lypressin , or terlipressin. Yet, flushing and \\ntransient headache are commonly  seen.  Local application of these agents results \\nin the occurrence of irritation in the nose, congestion, rhinitis, ulceration and \\nepistaxis. Belching (burping), nausea, abdominal cramps, pallor, urge to defecate , \\nand back pain in females (resulting from uterine contractions) are some of the \\nsystemic side effects of these drugs.  \\n \\nRetention of fluids and hyponatraemia (very low levels of sodium in blood) may \\nalso be seen.  Bradycardia increased cardiac afterload and precipitation of angina \\n(by constriction o f coronary vessels) may be caused by aqueous AVP. Urticaria  \\nand other allergies may also be seen .  \\n \\n3.2.3.8.  Drug Interactions  \\nAction of ADH is partially antagonised by lithium and demeclocycline (by \\nlimiting cAMP formation). These agents decrease the ability of ki dneys to \\nproduce concentrated urine. They may result in polyuria and polydipsia.

Thiazide Diuretics  \\nThe use of thiazide diuretics as anti -diuretic agents is seen in patients with \\ndiabetes insipidus . For such patients, high ceiling diuretics may also be \\nefficacious, however they are less wanted since their action is very short and \\nbrisk. The anti -diuretic effect of these thiazide agents is due to decreased urine \\noutput in both types of diabetes, pituitary as well as renal diabetes insipidus . \\nThey are part icularly effecting in the treatment of renal diabetes insipidus  in \\nwhich AVP is not effective. Yet, their efficiency is low as compared to the AVPs \\nas they do not have the ability to produce hypertonic urine as AVP.  \\n \\nAmiloride  is an example  of this class of drugs.  \\n \\n3.2.4.1.  Mechanism of Action  \\nThe exact mechanism of action of thiazide drugs as antidiuretic agents is not yet \\nunderstood. A possible mechanism of its action can be as follows :  \\n1) Thiazides bring about a state of continued electrolyte depletion , as a resul t of \\nwhich a further complete iso -osmotic reabsorption of glomerular filtrate \\noccurs in the proximal tubule. Additionally, lesser dilute urine reaches the \\ncollecting duct in a small volume due to reduced salt reabsorption in the \\ncortical diluting segment. Thus, the lesser dilute urine in smaller volume is \\npassed out. This mechanism of action is confirmed by the fact that restriction \\nof salts has a similar effect.  \\n2) The second mechanism of action is that the thiazides produce their anti -\\ndiuretic effect  by red ucing  glomerular filtration rate , and thus the fluid load \\non tubules.  \\n \\n3.2.4.2.  Therapeutic Uses  \\nThe most significant use of amiloride is the management of lithium -induced \\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus .

Introduction  \\nThe word autocoids derive  its origin from the Greek words autos  meaning self \\nand akos  meaning healing element . Auto coids are chemical signals produced \\nby different cells of the body. They act locally at the site where they  are \\nsynthesised and released ( e.g., at the site of inflammation within the \\ninflammatory pockets).  \\n \\nAutocoids  are chemical substances that are produced within the cells and are \\nreleased in response to different stimuli to cause various p hysiological actions. \\nMostly the action of auto coids is localised but large amounts of them can be \\ntransported through circulation to exert their eff ects at sites, other than where  \\nthey are synthesised. Since auto coids act local ly, they are also described as local \\nhormones .  \\n \\nAutocoids are biologically active compounds which act on smooth muscles of \\ndifferent tissues. Pathological conditions like inflammation, allergy, and \\nhypersensitivity result from an imbalance in their synthesis or release. Autocoids \\ninclude a wide range of substances having different structure and \\npharmacological activities, e.g., histamine, serotonin, eicosanoids, Platelet -\\nActivating Factor (PAF), and several polypeptides.  \\n \\n4.1.2.   Classification  \\nDepe nding on their chemical classes  (amine s, peptide s, or lipid s), auto coids are \\ncategorised as follows:  \\n1) Amines:  Histamines and Serotonin (or 5 -HT). \\n2) Polypeptides:  Bradykinin and Angiotensin . \\n3) Lipids:  \\ni) Eicosanoids or Arachidonic Acid Metabolites:  Leukotrienes, \\nThromboxanes, and Prostaglandins . \\nii) Platelet a ctivating factor .  \\n \\n4.1.3.

Pharmacological  Actions  \\nThe various physiological actions exerted by histamine on different organs and \\ntissues of the body are:  \\n1) Nervous System:  Histamine is known to be a potent stimulator of the \\nsensory nerves. The release of histamines in epidermis results in itching , \\nwher eas its release in dermis results in pain mediated via H 1 receptors. The \\nresponse to insect bites, in the form of urticaria (hives), mainly involves the \\nsensory nerve stimulation.  \\n2) Cardiovascular System  \\ni) Blood Vessels: Histamine causes constriction of large blood vessels and \\ndilatation of small arterioles. In humans, the most significant action of \\nhistamines is vasodilatation (decrease in blood pressure) involving both \\nH1 and H 2 receptors. Activation of H 1 receptors via Endothelium -Derived \\nRelaxing Factor (E DRF) (NO/PGI 2) is responsible for short -lived and \\nrapid vasodilatation.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 116}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Autocoids  (Chapter 4)  117 \\n*  *  \\nVasodilatation caused  by the activation of H 2 receptors occurs slowly \\nand continues (associated with a decrease in BP) via the cAMP -PKA \\npathway. A low dose of H 1-receptor antagonists block s the histamine \\nresponse, while a high dose of the same blunts the initial phase of the \\nresponse, which is seen to be quite large. A fall in the systemic blood \\npressure is generally complemented by reflex tachycardia.  \\nii) Increased Capillary Permeability:  This effect  is observed by \\nstimulation of H 1 receptors  that cause  contraction and separation of \\nendothelial cells. Thus, plasma proteins and fluids are allowed to \\nenter the extracellular space, resulting in oedema (a manifestation of \\nurticaria).  \\niii) Lewis’s T riple Response: In 1927 , Lewis  observed a characteristic  \\nTriple Response (TR)  on injecting histamine via intradermal route. It is \\nmarked by the following features : \\na) The injection site appears to be surrounded by a localised red \\ncoloured spot within a few se conds that maximises within a minute. \\nThe vasodilatory action of histamine causes such response.  \\nb) A bright red coloured flare or flush is seen surrounding the initial red \\nspot by up  to a centimetre. Stimulation of axon reflexes by histamine \\nleading to an in direct vasodilatation is responsible for the same.  \\nc) After 1 or 2 minutes, a wheal  or a swelling is seen at the injection \\nsite and also surrounding it. The fluid and protein exudation from the \\npost-capillary venules is responsible for such symptoms.  \\niv) Histami ne Shock:  Intravenous administration of histamine in large \\ndoses (as during anaphylaxis) causes an intense fall in blood pressure. \\nThis occurs as a result of the dilatation of blood vessels, which acquires \\nmore blood, thus increasing permeability, and decreasing venous return \\nand cardiac output.   \\nv) Heart:  The contractility of heart increases due to  stimulation of H 2 \\nreceptors. Thus, a stimulation of cardiac automaticity as well as SA and \\nAV nodal activities is observed.  \\n3) Histamine and Allergic Reaction: Once antigen interacts with IgE antibody \\n(or Fc receptor) present on the mast cell surface, the stored histamine is \\nreleased. This condition is evident in atopic individuals (immediate \\nhypersensitivity reaction is seen followed by allergy, i.e., smooth muscle \\nrelaxation and vasodilatation ). \\n \\nMany drugs , e.g., d-tubocurarine, morphine, vancomycin, polymyxin -B, \\ndextran, radiocontrast dyes, etc., have the property of releasing histamine \\nfrom mast cells, without sensitisation, but not from non -mast cells or \\ntissues ( e.g., gastric mucosa, epidermis, rapidly growing tissues, and CNS \\nneurons).  But these agents may cause anaphylactoid reaction (i.e., fall in \\nblood pressure, tachycardia, headache, urticaria , bronchospasm, and red \\nskin) .', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 117}),\n",

It is also responsible for controlling the release of \\nneurotransmitters (such as substance P and bradykinin ). Pathological states \\nlike myeloid leukaemia and carcinoid tumour (showing an increase in  \\nbasophil count) are associated with an increase in histamine which causes \\npruritus and flushing, respectively. Cold urticaria, solar urticaria, \\ncholinergic urticaria, scratching urticaria, etc., are also associated with \\nhistamine release.  \\n \\nRelease of his tamines is the only cause for an allergic reaction; however, it \\nhas now been proved that sensitised mast cells also release histamine along  \\nwith various other substances , such as eicos anoids, PAF, kinins, and 5 -HT.  \\n4) Histamine and Gastric Acid Secretion:  Histamine is a potent gastric acid \\nsecretion mediated by the action of H 2 receptors on gastric parietal cells. If \\nH2 receptors are blocked, the secretion of acid in response to histamine, \\ngastrin, and vagal stimulation is eliminated. Patients suffering from peptic \\nulcer are treated with H2 receptor antagonists.  \\n5) Action on Smooth Muscles:  Smooth muscles contract and relax on \\nactivation of H1 and H2  receptors, respectively . The most important action of \\nH1 receptors is to mediate constriction of bronchial muscles  in asthma \\npatients ; however , this response is not so prominent among individuals not \\nsuffering from any such disease. Relaxant responses precipitated by the \\nstimulation of H2 receptor are overshadowed by the dominant H1 action.  \\n \\n4.1.3.5.  Pathophysiological Actions  \\nThe various pathophysiological actions exerted by histamine are:  \\n1) Gastric Secretion:  HCl secretion in stomach is  mediated by histamines , and \\nit shows a high turnover rate. On being stimulated, histamine is rel eased \\nlocally from histaminocytes present near the parietal cells.  \\n2) Allergic  Phenomena:  Histamine primarily mediates hypersensitivity \\nreactions. Histamine is released from the mast cells , and an antigen -antibody \\nreaction occurs on their surface resulting in urticaria, angioedema, \\nbronchoconstriction, and anaphylactic shock. The hypothalamus and \\nmidbrain have non -mast cell histamine which is responsible for restlessness.  \\n3) Inflammation : Histamines mediate vasodilatation and changes occurring \\nduring inflammation . Leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium is \\npromoted by histamines by the expression of adhesion molecule , i.e., P-\\nselectin on endothelial cell surface . This leads  to the sequestration of \\nleukocytes at the inflammation site. Histamine may also help in the \\nregulation of microcirculation depending on the local needs.  \\n4) Tissue Growth  and Repair:  Histamine has been implicated in the process of \\ntissue growth and repair since growing and regenerating tissues contain \\nhistamine in high concentrations.  \\n5) Headache : Histamine also plays a role in headache that is vascular in origin, \\nalthough no conclusive evidence has been obtained as yet.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 118}),\n",

They are primarily \\nemployed for allergy testing , for the assessment of histamine sensitivity , and for \\ntesting the function of gastric secretion (they have been replaced with \\npentagastri n, which is a synthetic peptide analogue of gastrin having lesser \\nadverse effects).  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nHistamine agonists may cause f lushing, burning sensations, hypotension, \\ntachycardia, and bronchoconstriction.  \\n \\n4.1.4.  Histamine Antagonists  (Antihistamines)  \\nHistamine antagonists are the drugs that antagonise the histamine action. \\nFollowing are the three types  of histamine receptor antagonists:  \\n1) H1-Antagonists:  These are classical antihistamines which block  the \\nphysiological effects of histamine and are used in allergic disorders.  \\n2) H2-Antagonists: Cimetidine, Ranitidine , and Famotidine are the examples  \\nof H2-antagonists which reduce the  gastric HCl secretion and are used in \\npeptic ulcer.  \\n3) H3-Antagonists: Thioperamide is an example  of H3-antagonist which \\nregulates histamine release from histaminergic neurons of CNS by \\npresynaptic auto -regulatory mechanism. It is not recommended to be used \\ntherapeutically.  \\n \\nThe effects of histamine can be antagonised by two groups of drugs:  \\n1) Physiological Ant agonist s: The classical example  of this group of  histamine \\nantagonist is adrenaline. These  antagonists act at different receptor sites on \\nthe same biological system but elicit opposite response; for example,  \\nhistamine acts on H 1 receptors of bronchial smoo th muscles and blood \\nvessels to elicit bronchoconstriction and vasodilatation or fall in BP, whereas \\nadrenaline acts as \\uf0622-receptors of bronchial smooth muscles and α 1-receptor \\nof blood vessels to produce bronchodila tion and vasoconstriction or rise of \\nBP and thereby counteracts the deleterious effects of histamine in \\nanaphylactic shock.  \\n2) Pharmacological or Receptor Antagonists:  These antagonists are either \\ncompetitive or non -competitive inhibitors of histamine at receptor sites. They \\nblock the effects of hi stamine by receptor occupancy.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 119}),\n",

H 1 antagonists were termed as antihistamines . They cause a \\ncompetitive inhi bition of only H 1 receptors . Adrenaline (a physiological \\nantagonist of histamine ) acts via adrenergic receptors and reverses the \\nbronchodilation and vasoconstriction effects of histamine. Histamine release \\nfrom mast cells is blocked by cromolyn sodium and corticosteroids. H 1 receptor \\nantagonists are employed in the treatment of allergic disorders.  \\n \\nClassification  \\n1) First Generation  H1-Antagonists: They cross the blood -brain barrier \\nreadily and produce drowsiness.  \\ni) Ethanolamines : Diphenhydramine hydrochloride  and Dimenhydrinate.  \\nii) Ethylenediamines : Pyrilamine maleate and T ripelennamine \\nhydrochloride . \\niii) Alkylamines : Chlorpheniramine maleate and Brompheniramine maleate . \\niv) Piperazines : Cyclizine hydrochloride and M eclizine hydrochloride . \\nv) Piperidines : Cyproheptadine hydr ochloride . \\nvi) Phenothiazines : Promethazine hydrochloride.  \\nvii) Tricyclic  Dibenzoxepins : Doxepin hy drochloride.  \\n2) Second  Generation  H1-Antagonists: They do not cross the blood -brain \\nbarrier readily , thus produce less drowsiness.  \\ni) Alkylamines : Acrivastine . \\nii) Piperazines : Cetirizine hydrochloride . \\niii) Phthalazinones : Azelastine hydrochloride . \\niv) Piperidines : Terfenadine, Astemizole , Loratadine , and Fexofenadine.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nThe action of histamines on H 1 receptors is blocked by antihistamines (H 1 \\nblockers) categorised in to first - and second -generations. The binding of first-\\ngeneration  antihistamines is seen on central and peripheral H 1 receptors while \\nthat of second -generation  antihistamines  is seen  on peripheral H 1 receptors. \\nThough the sedative effects of second -generat ion antihistamines are lesser as \\ncompared to those of first -generation antihistamine, still they are beneficial for \\nthe treatment of allergies.  \\n \\nPharmacological Actions  \\n1) Histamine Antagonism:  The histamine actions ( e.g., dilatation of \\ncapillaries, decrease in BP, urticaria, allergic reactions, itching, contraction \\nof smooth muscle s, and triple response formation) are effectively blocked by \\nH1 antihistamines. However anaphylactic shock is only partially prevented by \\nantihistamines. It should be remembered tha t histamine is not alwa ys the \\nonly cause of an allergy, so all allergic reactions may not be blocked by \\nantihistamines; for example,  leukotriene and PAF are more significant \\nmediators in asthma , thus they cannot be controlled by antihistamines alone. \\nH1 blockers also show no effect on HCl secretion.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 120}),\n",

They are also se en to accelerate the effects of \\nCNS depressants. Promethazine (phenargan) possesses sedative effects. \\nRecently discovered H 1 antagonists ( e.g., astemizole, terfenadine, loratadine, \\ncetirizine, and fexofenadine) do not possess sedative effects because they do \\nnot show absorption in brain.  \\n4) Anticholinergic Actions:  Diphenhydramine, promethazine, and pheniramine \\nare the H 1-antihistamines acting as potent anticholinergic agents. They \\nreduce lacrimal and nasal secretions while accounting for dryness of mouth . \\nThis anticholinergic action is beneficial for treating conditions like motion \\nsickness and Parkinsonism.  \\n5) Antiemetic and Antitussive Actions:  Morning sickness (vomiting during \\npregnancy) and motion sickness can be effectively prevented by some H 1-\\nantihistamine s. \\n6) Local Anaesthetic Effect:  Some antihistamines ( e.g., mepyramine and \\nantazoline) possess local anaesthetic effects, still are not employed for this \\npurpose.  \\n7) Blood Pressure : Intravenous administration of most antihistamine s results in \\na decrease in blood pressure which is not seen in case of oral administration \\nof these agents.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses  \\n1) Allergic Disorders:  H1 antihistamines provide symptomatic relief to various \\nallergic states like  urticaria, acute or chronic dermatitis, pruritus, hay fever, \\nand a llergic rhinitis. Itching and urticaria occurring as a result of drug \\nreactions can be treated using H 1 blockers. Though they are known to prevent \\nthe occurrence of anaphylaxis , however once anaphylactic conditions result, \\nthey are not able to treat  the sa me. For example,  adrenaline is the drug of \\nchoice in treating anaphylactic conditions , while glucocorticoids are used to \\ntreat the long -lasting effects after anaphylaxis.  \\n \\nH1 receptor blockers are ineffective to treat asthma mediated by histamine \\nand other  mediators.

Cinnarizine  acts by controlling \\nthe movement of Ca2+ ions and is useful in treating vertigo.  \\n6) Motion Sickness:  Antihistamines ( e.g., ethanolamines, piperazines , and \\nphenothiazines) are useful in motion sickness to relieve nausea, vomiting , \\nand vertigo when given prophylactically atleast one hour before the start of \\nthe journey. They are also effective in drug -induced and post -operative \\nvomiting, radiation sickness, and morning sickness.  \\n7) Other Conditions:  Antihistamines are also used as an ing redient in cough \\nsyrups for treating common cold.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\n1) CNS: In addition to producing adverse effects like  sedation, lack of \\nconcentration, fatigue, and a tendency to fall asleep, antihistamines also \\naccelerate the effect of other sedatives (like alcohol and tranquilisers ). \\nHence, after consuming antihistamines, patients are advised not to drive or \\nwork on machines.  \\n2) Anti -Muscarinic Effect:  As a result of the anticholinergic effects of \\nantihistamines, dryness of mouth and nose and blurred vision m ay be \\nexperience d by the patient.  \\n3) CVS:  Antihistamines result in  hypotension and palpitations.  \\n4) Teratogenic Effects: Administration of  some antihistamines ( e.g., cyclizine \\nand meclizine) should be avoided during pregnancy as they possess \\nteratogenic effects.  \\n5) Overdose Effects:  Central excitation, tremors, convulsions, flushing, and \\nhypotension result from acute overdose of antihistamines. Respiratory and \\ncardiovascular failure results in death.  \\n \\nRecently synthesised compounds ( e.g, acrivastine, levocetirizine,  deslorat adine, \\nterfenadine, astemizole, and lorata dine) are pure H 1 antihistamines.

Pharmacological Actions  \\nVarious types of PGs bind to their respective receptors (oppos ite to each other) \\nand produce related actions in tissues  and sites where they are released due to \\ninflammation, pain, trauma, allergic reactions, and bacterial attack.  \\n \\nThe major pharmacological actions produced by prostaglandins are:  \\n1) CVS:  Vasodilatation and fal l in blood pressure are caused by intravenously \\ninjected PGE 2\\uf061, PGF 2%, and PGI 2 (stronger than acetylcholine and histamine). \\nThromboxane A 2 produces vasoconstriction, but the actions are non -uniform.  \\n2) Platelets:  Platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction are  caused by \\nthromboxane A 2, whereas PGI 2 prevents platelet aggregation and causes \\nvasodilatation. Thromboxane synthesis and haemostasis is interfered by \\naspirin, which inhibits platelet aggregation. Since nucleus is absent in platelets, \\nthey cannot synthesi se COX, and haemostasis occurs by only fresh platelets.  \\n3) Bronchial Muscle s: PGF 2\\uf061, PGD 2, and thromboxaneA 2 are potent \\nbronchoconstrictors, while PGE 2 is a strong bronchodilator. But aspirin is not \\neffective in asthma because it is mediated by many biologica lly active \\nconstituents. An imbalance between the constrictor and dilator PGs may also \\nbe the cause of asthma.  \\n4) Reproductive System:  During the early stages of pregnancy , uterus \\ncontraction is brought about by PGE 2 and PGF 2\\uf061 as the sensitivity of uterus \\ntowards PGs is more than towards oxytocin. Dysmenorrhoea pain is the \\ncause of increased PG synthesis; therefore, this type of pain can be relieved \\nby aspirin -like drugs.  \\n \\nThe transport of sperm, fertilis ation, and initiation and progression of labour \\nare als o facilitated by PGs.

They \\ncause vasodila tion, increased blood flow, and diuresis. TAX 2 causes renal \\nvasoconstriction, while increase in release of renin is caused by PGI 2, PGE 2, \\nand PGD 2. \\n7) Inflammation:  PGs are also involved in inflammation, as most of the \\nsymptoms, e.g., redness, pain, colour (due to increased vascul arity), and \\nswelling (due to increased capillary permeability) are explained by PGs. \\nTherefore, the synthesis of PGs and inflammation are reduced by aspirin and \\nother NSAIDs.  \\n8) Other Actions:  ANS, endocrine system, and peripheral nerves are also diversely \\naffected by PGs.

PGI 1 (e.g., misoprostol, 200 \\uf06dg; rioprostil, 150 \\uf06dg) and PGE 2 (e.g., \\nenprostil, 35 \\uf06dg) are the preparations used in peptic ulcer.  \\n3) Asthma:  Some types of PGE 2 can also be used for treating asthma.  \\n4) CVS:  PGs are also used in hypertension to inhibit the d amage of platelets in \\nblood to reduce infarct size and peripheral vascular diseases.

In kidneys, direct vasoconstriction is strongest, while it is \\nless in the splanchnic vascular bed.  \\nii) Enhancement of Peripheral Noradrenergic Neurotransmission: AT-\\nII prevents nor-adrenaline uptake from the adrenergic nerve endings and Liver  \\nCorticosteroids,O\\nestrogen  Angiotensin II \\nVasopressin \\nPlasma K+ Adrenergic ( \\uf062) Angiotensinogen (14 AA) \\n(Plasma \\uf0612 Globulin)  \\nRenin  JG Cells of \\nKidney  \\nPepstatin  \\nReduced B.P. \\n(Renal)  Angiotensin I (10 AA) \\n(Inactive)  \\nAngiotensin Converting \\nEnzyme (ACE) (Pulmonary \\ncirculation)  Low Plasma Na+ \\nAngiotensin II \\nrecep tor \\nantagonists  Angiotensin II (8AA)  \\nAngiotensin III (7AA)  \\nAngiotensinases  \\nPeptide fragments (inactive)  +  – \\n+  +  \\nAminopeptidase  Losartan \\nValsartan  \\nCaptopril \\nTeprotide \\nEnalapril  \\nFigure 4.3: Synthesis and Metabolism of Angiotensins, and the D rugs which Interfere with \\nthe Synthesis of Angiotensin II.

Several  studies \\nsuggest that ACE inhibitors are effective in weakening the cardiac re -\\nmodelling after MI. Studies also show that the re -modelling process involves \\ndirect AT-II effects and indirect effects via the kallikrein -kinin system.  \\n \\nMigration , proliferation, and hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts \\nare stimulated by AT-II. By directly acting on the cardiac cells, AT-II \\ninduces the expression of specific proto -oncogenes. By increasing the \\npreload (due to volume expansion ) and afterload (due to increased arterial \\npressure ), AT-II also increases the cardiac workload.  \\n4) Effects on Kidneys: AT-II directly  stimulates the Na+/H+ exchange  and \\nincreases the re-absorption  of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate  ions. The \\nzona glomerulosa of adrenal cor tex is stimulated by  AT-II to increase the \\nsynthesis and release of aldosterone which causes retention of Na+ and \\nCl– ions and water. Both these effects increase the  extracellular fluid \\nvolume.  \\n5) Effects on CNS: Along  with its central effects on blood press ure, AT-II also \\nacts on the CNS for stimulating drinking and increasi ng vasopressin and \\nACTH secretion . \\n \\n4.1.10.4.

The AT 1 receptor antagonists do not affect the metabolism of  bradykinin, \\nthus, their use may reduce the occurrence of dru g-induced cough and \\nangioedema .  \\n \\nBut, the AT 1 receptor antagonists produce less effective vasodilation because of \\ntheir incapability to potentiate the vasodilatory ef fects of bradykinin.

Introduction  \\nNon-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs  (NSAIDs) are used to treat \\ninflammation, mild -to-moderate pain, and fever. Specific uses include the \\ntreatment of headache, arthritis, sports injuries, and menstrual cramps. Aspirin is \\nused to inhibit the clotting of blood and prevent strokes and heart attacks in \\nindividuals at high risk. NSAIDs are also included in many cold and allergic \\npreparations.  \\n \\nThe incidence  of side effects depends on the drugs. The most common side \\neffects of NSAIDs are GIT disturbances, like nausea, vomiting, constipation, \\ndiarrhoea, peptic ulcer, and decreased appetit e. They  may also cause fluid \\nretention which leads to oedema. The most serious side effects are liver failure , \\nkidney failure , ulcers, and continued bleeding after an injury or surgery.  \\n \\nThe individuals who are allergic to NSAIDs develop breath lessness on \\nadministration of NSAIDs. Asthma patients are at higher risk a nd suffer from \\nsevere  allergic reaction s. Reye’s syndrome may occur in children and \\nteenagers if they have administered aspirin when suffering from chicken pox \\nor influenza.  Thus, children and teenagers with suspected or confirmed \\nchicken pox or influenza should not be administered with aspirin and \\nsalicylate.  \\n \\nDrugs reducing the raised body temperature are antipyretics . Inflammation \\ncaused by Prostaglandin (PGE 2) is cured or prevented by using anti-\\ninflammatory agents . These drugs are extensively used for relieving  minor \\naches, fever, pains, and for symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, \\nrheumatic fever, and osteoarthritis.  \\n \\n5.1.2.  Mechanism of Action  \\nNSAIDs inhibit Cycloxygenase (COX) enzyme , which catalyses  the synthesis of \\ncyclic endoperoxides from arac hidonic acid to form PGs . There are two COX \\nisoenzymes , i.e., COX -1 and COX -2. PGs which are associated with normal \\ncellular activit y (protection of gastric mucosa and  maintenance of kidney \\nfunction)  are produced by COX -1, while  COX -2 produces  PGs at the \\ninflammation sites.

An elaborated mechanism of action of NSAIDs can be studied with \\nrespect to the following effects:  \\n1) Anti -Inflammatory Effect s: These effects of NSAIDs  include :  \\ni) This effect of NSAIDs is due to the inhibition of COX enzymes that \\nproduce prostaglandin H synthase by converting  arachidonic acid into \\nprostaglandins, TXA 2, and prostacyclin.  \\nii) Aspirin irreversibly inactivates COX -1 and COX -2 by acet ylation of a \\nspecific serine residue. This distinguishes it from other NSAIDs, which \\nreversibly inhibit COX -1 and COX -2. \\niii) NSAIDs have no effect on lipoxygenase , and therefore do not inhibit \\nleukotriene production.   \\niv) Additional anti -inflammatory mechanisms m ay include interference with \\nthe potentiative action of other mediators of inflammation (bradykinin, \\nhistamine, and serotonin), modulation of T -cell function, stabilisation of \\nlysosomal membranes, and inhibition of chemotaxis.  \\n2) Analgesic Effect s: These effects of NSAIDs include : \\ni) This effect of NSAIDs is  related to the peripheral inhibition of \\nprostaglandin production, but it may also be due to the inhibition of pain \\nstimuli at a sub -cortical site.   \\nii) NSAIDs prevent the potentiating action of prostaglandins on  endogenous \\nmediators of peripheral nerve stimulation ( e.g., bradykinin).  \\n3) Antipyretic Effect s: These  effect s of NSAIDs is related to inhibition of \\nproduction of prostaglandins induced by interleukin -1 (IL -1) and interleukin -\\n6 (IL -6) in the hypothalamus and  the “re -setting” of the thermoregulatory \\nsystem, leading to vasodilatation and increased heat loss.

Mechanism of Actio n \\nThe analgesic, antipyretic, and anti -inflammatory effects of aspirin are exerted  by \\nthe acetyl and the salicylate portions of the intact molecule as well by the active \\nsalicylate metabolite. Aspirin directly and irreversibly inhibits the activity of \\nCOX -1 and COX -2 to decrease the formation of precursors of prostaglandins and \\nthromboxanes from arachidonic acid. This makes aspirin different from other \\nNSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen) which are reversible inhibitors. \\nSalicylate may competitively in hibit prostaglandin formation. Aspirin’s anti -\\nrheumatic (non -steroidal anti -inflammatory) ac tions are a result of its analgesic \\nand anti -inflammatory mechanisms.  \\n \\n5.1.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  \\nAspirin on oral administration  is absorbed quickly, mostly from the upper pa rt of \\nsmall intestine (due to large surface area and also where the drug is mostly \\nionised) and partly from the stomach (where  the drug is moslty  unionised ). After \\nabsorption, aspirin rapidly hydrolyses  into acetic acid and salicylate  bound to \\nplasma prote ins (especially albumin ). However, the unbound fraction of \\nsalicylate increases with the increase in serum concentration. Salicylate \\nbiotransformation increases in the mitochondria and hepatic endoplasmic \\nreticulum. Salicylate formed by hydrolysing aspirin  can be excreted as such or as \\nwater -soluble conjugates like ether, salicyluric acid (the glycine conjugate), or', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 147}),\n",

Within 1 -2 hours peak \\nplasma levels are reached and the serum half -life of aspirin is 3-5 hours . In high \\ndoses  (4gm/day) however , the half -life of aspirin increases to 15 hours or more. \\nHence, aspirin metabolises following  first-order kinetics when given in low doses \\n(600mg) and changes to zero -order kinetics at higher doses. This effect t akes a \\nweek as the hepatic enzymes metabolising salicylate are saturated.  \\n \\n5.1.4.3.  Pharmacological Actions  \\nThe pharmacological actions of aspirin are given below:  \\n1) Anti -Inflammatory Action:  Aspirin is a highly effective anti -inflammatory \\nagent which inhibits  PG syn thesis. Though, aspirin has also been found to be \\ninterfering with chemical mediators of kallikrein system, stabilising \\nlysosomes , and inhibiting the polymorphs and macrophages from migrating  \\ninto the inflammatory sites.  \\n2) Analgesic Action:  Aspirin is effici ent in relieving non -visceral pain; \\nhowever, its analgesic effect is milder  than that of codeine. The major \\nmechanism is inhibition of peripheral PG synthesis, but a central part which \\npossibly involves PGs, cannot be ignored.  \\n3) Antipyretic Action:  Inhibitio n of hypothalamic PG synthesis is associated \\nwith the antipyretic action of aspirin. It lowers the elevated body temperature \\nby sweating and peripheral vasodilatation which promotes heat loss.  \\n4) Effect on Respiration:  Therapeutic doses of aspirin increase  CO 2 production \\nthrough its metabolic effects and also stimulate  the respiratory centre. The \\nrate and depth of respiration is increased by larger doses of aspirin which \\ninduce  direct stimulation of respiratory centre. Renal loss of bicarbonates \\ncompensates th e respiratory alkalosis that may develop.  \\n5) Metabolic Effects:  Due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in \\nskeletal muscles, aspirin increases  O2 consumption and CO 2 production. \\nMetabolic acidosis occurs in severe poisoning due to accumulat ion of lacti c \\nand pyruvic acids. This accumulation is the result of  intervention of enzymes \\nof the Kreb’s cycle and the build -up of acetoacetic acid due to increase in \\nlipid metabolism.  \\n6) Effects on Blood: PGI 2 inhibits and platelet TXA 2 induces platelet \\naggregation . Generation of both eicosanoids is inhibited by aspirin in \\ntherapeutic doses, but thromboxane synthesis is inhibited and endothelial \\nPGI 2 levels remain  unaffected  by low doses of aspirin.  \\n7) Endocrine Effects: Thyroid hormones are displaced from the protein \\nbinding sites and adrenocorticoids are displaced from the plasma pro tein \\nbinding sites by aspirin. Release of a drenal steroid is increased by aspirin \\nonly in large doses . \\n8) Gastrointestinal Tract:  Aspirin inhibits mucoprotective PGs, thus induces \\ngastric and i ntestinal erosions and haemorrhage.  \\n9) Acid -Base and Electrolyte Balance: The acid-base and electrolyte \\ncomposition of body fluids are changed by anti -inflammatory doses  of', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",

Adults manifest this phase in late stages of \\npoisoning, while children manifest it during salicylate poisoning. Increased water \\nloss in urine (to accompany Na+, K+, and\\n–3 HCO ions) and increased sweating and \\nhyperventilation causes dehydration during poisoning.  \\n \\n10) CVS: No direct effect is produced by therapeutic doses of aspirin.

Therapeutic Uses  \\nThe therapeutic uses of aspirin are given bel ow: \\n1) As Analgesic: It is used in dysmenorrhoea, headache (including mild migraine), \\nbackache, joint pain, toothache, neuralgias, myalgia, and pulled muscle.  \\n2) As Antipyretic: It efficiently reduces fever in the same d ose as used in \\nanalgesia . But, generally p aracetamol is preferred as it is much  safer.  \\n3) Acute Rheumatic Fever: It is the first drug that is used in every case.  When  \\nit is not effective or in severe cases, other drugs can be  added or substituted \\n(corticosteroids act faster).   \\n4) Rheumatoid Arthritis:  3-5gm/day dose of aspirin relieves pain, swelling , \\nand morning stiffness, but does not affect the progress of disease.   \\n5) Osteoarthritis: It only provides symptomatic relief , and paracetamol is the \\npreferred  analgesic for most cases.  \\n6) Post-Myocardial Infarct ion and Post -Stroke Patients: It lowers the \\nincidence of re -infarction by inhibiting platelet aggregation.  \\n \\n5.1.4.5.  Adverse Effects  \\nThe side effects of aspirin include:  \\n1) Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Commonest adverse effects are epigastric \\ndistress, heartburn, abdomi nal pain, and vomiting due to gastric erosions and \\nbleeding.

Introduction  \\nGout is a hereditary metabolic disease characterised by overproduction of uric \\nacid. It is manifested clinically by intermittent attacks of acute arthritis due to \\ndeposition of urate crystals in  synovial tissue of joints.  \\n \\nThe inflammatory response is characterised by local generation of inflammatory \\nmediators, including leukotrienes (LTs) and PGs, and migration of neutrophil \\ngranulocytes into the inflamed area.  \\n \\nThe accumulated neutrophils eng ulf the urate crystals by phagocytosis and \\ninduce the generation of toxic oxygen free radicals, which in turn cause \\nlysis of the cell with release of proteolytic enzymes that sustain the \\ninflammation.  \\n \\nUrates also stimulate the release of IL -1. Uric acid is synthesised from xanthine \\nby the action of xanthine oxidase enzyme and is excreted by the kidneys by \\nactive tubular secretion.  \\n \\n6.1.2.  Classification  \\nAnti-gout drugs can be classified as follows:  \\n1) Based on their Mechanism of Action  \\ni) Inhibit Uric Acid Synthesis:  Allopurinol.  \\nii) Increase Uric Acid Excretion:  Probenecid and Sulphinpyrazone.  \\niii) Inhibit Neutrophil Migration into Joint:  Colchicine.  \\niv) Inhibit Inflammation and Pain:  NSAIDs.  \\n2) Based on their Clinical Use  \\ni) Drugs Used in Acute Gout:  Colchicine, NSAIDs, and Prednisolon e.  \\nii) Drugs Used in Chronic Gout:  Allopurinol, Probenecid, and \\nSulphinpyrazone.  \\n \\n6.1.3.  Mechanism of Action  \\nThe anti -gout action is not clear, but it is probably due to inhibition  \\nof neutrophil migration to urate deposited area, thereby decreasing \\nphagocytosis of urates and inhibition of subseque nt events inducing \\ninflammation ( figure 6.1).

Therapeutic Uses  \\nAnti-gout drugs are  used to treat  gout and certain types of  kidney stones . They \\nare also used to prevent increased uric acid levels in patients \\nreceiving  cancer  chemotherapy. These patients can have increased uric acid \\nlevels due to release of uric acid from the dying cancer  cells. The anti -gout drugs \\nreduce  the amount of uric acid made by the body.  \\n \\n6.1.5.  Adverse Effects  \\nThe adverse effects of anti -gout drugs include:  \\n1) Fever, sore throat, and headache with a severe blistering, pe eling, and red \\nskin rash,  \\n2) Pain or bleeding while urinating,  \\n3) Nausea, upper stomach pain, itching, appetite loss, weight loss, dark urine, \\nclay-coloured stools, jaundice,  \\n4) Urinating less than usual or not at all,  \\n5) Joint pain, and flu symptoms,  \\n6) Severe tingling,  numbness, pain, and muscle weakness, and  \\n7) Unusual bleeding from nose, mouth, vagina, or rectum.  \\n \\n6.1.6.

It has a  plasma half-life \\nof 8-10 hours . It is 90% bound to plasma protein s. It is partially conjugated in \\nliver and excreted through kidney.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Use  \\nProbenecid  is used in chronic gout and h yperuricemia. It is also used to increase \\nblood concentrations of penicillins and cephalosporins.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nMild gastrointestinal upsets and skin rashes are the common adverse effects. It \\nmay precipitate haemolytic anaemia in the presence of G -6-PD deficiency.  \\n \\nInteractions  \\n1) Probenecid  with penicillins inhibits  the urinary excretion of cephalosporins, \\nmethotrexate , indomethacin, and sulphonamides.  \\n2) The uricosu ric action of probenecid is interfered by pyrazinamide and ethambutol.  \\n3) Probenecid also inhibit s the biliary excretion of rifampicin.  \\n4) Probenecid inhibits the t ubular secretion of nitrofurantoin, which fails to  \\nattain antibacterial concentration in urine.  \\n5) The uricosuric action of probenecid is blocked by salicylates.  \\n \\n6.1.6.2.  Colchicine  \\nColchicine is an alkaloid obtained from Colchicum autumnale , and used in \\nneoplastic disease because of its antimitotic activity. It is used to relieve the \\ninflammation of acute gouty arthritis attacks. It is especially effective in relievin g \\npain if given promptly. When colchicine is given during the first several months \\nof therapy with other anti -gout medications, it may prevent the gouty attacks that \\nsometimes occur with these drugs.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nIn patients with gout, colchicine i nterrupts the cycle of monosodium urate crystal \\ndeposition in joint tissues by inhibiting glucose oxidation, subsequent lactic acid \\nproduction in leukocytes, and the resultant inflammatory response that initiates \\nand sustains an acute attack. Colchicine de creases leukocyte  chemotaxis and \\nphagocytosis and inhibits the formation and release of a chemotactic glycoprotein \\nproduced during phagocytosis of urate crystals.  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nColchicine exhibits enterohepatic circulation and gets absorbed from gut . It is \\npartially metabolised in the liver. It has a short half-life but still can be found in \\nneutrophils for a few  days after single administration.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Use  \\nColchicine is used in acute gout and prevention of acute attacks.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nSome co mmon and severe adverse effects of colchicine are abdominal pain, \\nvomiting, diarrhoea, renal damage, bone marrow suppression, peripheral \\nneuropathy, and myopathy.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 163}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='164 Pharmacology   \\n*  * 6.1.6.3.  NSAIDs  \\nNSAIDs  suppress the pain and inflammation of acute g out. Aspirin is not \\nrecommended due to uric acid retention. Indomethacin is highly efficient in  \\n75-200mg orally in divided doses.  Piroxicam , naproxen, sulindac, azapropazone, \\nand diclofenac are other alternatives . Prednisolone can also be administered  in \\n40mg orally in divided doses . These drugs are pharmaceutically important as \\nmost patients may not tolerate colchicine.  \\n \\n6.1.6.4.  Allopurinol  \\nAllopurinol is a purine compound which is chemically similar  to hypoxanthine.  \\n \\nMechan ism of Action  \\nAllopurinol and its metabolite,  alloxanthine decreases uric acid synthesis from \\nhypoxanthine and xanthine by inhibiting the xanthine oxidase enzyme. This \\nresults in decrease of relatively insoluble urates in tissue with concomitant \\nincrease i n soluble xanthine and hypoxanthine, which are readily excreted.  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nNearly 80% allopurinol is absorbed on oral administration . It does not bind to \\nplasma proteins and is metabolised to alloxanthine. In prolonged usage, it s \\nmetabolism is inhi bited by itself and nearly 1/3rd of the drug is excreted \\nunchanged and the remaining  as alloxanthine.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Use  \\nAllopurinol is used in chronic gout and in prevention of acute exacerbations.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects   \\n1) The most recurrent adverse effects are h ypersensitivity reactions such as \\nfever, rashes, muscle pain, and malaise. These reactions recede  when the \\ntherapy is stopped. In cases of renal impairment, the occurrence of rashes and \\nother reactions to allopurinol increases.  \\n2) Stevens -Johnson syndrome i s an occasional but severe risk of this drug.  \\n3) This drug is not w ithdraw n for occasional effects like nausea, headache, \\ngastric irritation , and dizziness.  \\n4) Liver damage occurs  rarely. \\n \\nDrug Interactions  \\n1) The doses of 6 -mercaptopurine and azathioprine should be  reduced to 1/3rd as \\nallopur inol inhibits their degradation;  but the doses of thioguanine should not \\nbe reduced as it gets metabolised by S -methylation . \\n2) Allopurinol and p robenecid together form  a complex interaction. Probenecid \\nshortens the half-life of alloxanthine while  allopurinol increases the half-life \\nof probenecid.  \\n3) Allopurinol inhibits warfarin and theophylline metabolism, hence, increases \\ntheir effects.  \\n4) Ampicillin when administered to patients taking  allopurinol  causes a high \\noccurrence of skin rash es.  \\n5) During allopurinol treatment, iron therapy is avoided.

Sulfinpyrazone  \\nSulfinpyra zone is a potent pyrazolidine derivative, and a uricosuric agent for gout. \\nAt therapeutic doses, it promotes urinary secretion of uric acid and reduces serum \\nurate levels by competitively inhibiting renal tubular re -absorption of uric acid. It is \\nused for patients who are under -excretors of uric acid. As it has no apparent \\nanalgesic or anti -inflammatory activity, it is not used for relief of acute gout.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nSulfinpyrazone competitively inhibits uric acid reabsorption at the proximal \\nconvolu ted tubule, thereby facilitating urinary excretion of uric acid and \\ndecreasing plasma urate concentrations. Sulfinpyrazone is not intended for the \\ntreatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic and \\nanti-inflammatory effects.  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nSulfinpyrazon e gets absorbed  on oral administration. It is extensively  bound to \\nplasma proteins ( 98%) and displa cement interactions may arise. It gets rapidly \\nexcreted , prima rily through active secretion in proximal tubule. Uricosuric acti on \\nof a particular dose stays for 6 -10 hours.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Uses  \\nSulfinpyrazone is used in maintenance therapy in chronic gouty arthritis and \\ntophaceous gout. Its unlabelled uses include drug -induced hyperuricemia, and \\ndecreasing platelet aggregation.  \\n \\nAdve rse Effects  \\nThe adverse effects of sulfinpyrazone include u pper GI disturbances,  nausea,  \\ndiarrhoea,  blood loss,  reactivation or aggravation of peptic ulcer,  precipitation of \\nacute gout attacks,  rashes (l ess frequently ), jaundice , blood dyscrasias ( anaemia,  \\nagranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia ), and  bronchoconstriction in patients with \\naspirin -induced asthma.  \\n \\n6.2. ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGS  \\n \\n6.2.1.  Introduction  \\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a type of autoimmune disease, characterised by the \\ninflammation in joints, synovial prolif eration, and destruction of articular cartilage. \\nThe first line drugs used in the treatment of RA are NSAIDs that help in relieving \\npain, swelling, morning stiffness, immobility, but do not show complete cure.  \\n \\nAnti-rheumatic drugs  are specific anti -inflammatory or analgesics, used to \\nsuppress the rheumatoid process and also bring the remission. These drugs do not \\ninclude corticosteroids. They can be used along with the NSAIDs and are also \\ncalled as Disease Modifying Anti -Rheuma tic Drugs (DMARDs)  or Slow \\nActing Anti -Rheumatic Drugs (SAARDs) .  \\n \\nThe complete action of the DMARDs is achieved in few months of regular \\ntreatment and the complete relapse is achieved after a few months of the therapy. \\nThe recent development in this thera py is the addition of a few Biological \\nResponse Modifiers (BRMs)  in case of resistance.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 165}),\n",

Classification  \\nThe anti -rheumatic drugs are classified as follows : \\n1) Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)  \\ni) Immun osuppressants – Methotrexate, Azathioprine, and Cyclosporine.  \\nii) Sulfasalazine.  \\niii) Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine.  \\niv) Leflunomide.  \\nv) Gold sodium thiomalate and  Auranofin.  \\nvi) D-Penicillamine.  \\n2) Biologic Response Modifiers (BRMs)  \\ni) TNF\\uf061 Inhibitors:  Etanercept, Infliximab, and Adalimumab.  \\nii) IL-1 Antagonist:  Anakinra.  \\n3) Adjuva nt Drugs : Corticosteroids – Prednisolone.  \\n \\n6.2.3. Disease Modifyin g Anti -Rheumatic Drugs  (DMARDs)  \\nThe DMARDs have the capability of reducing the joint pain in patients of \\nrheumatoid arthritis. Gold salts, glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, \\nand many other newer immunologic drugs ( like leflunomide, etanercept, and \\ninfliximab) are the common examples  of DMARDs. These drugs have a very slow \\nonset of action and anti -rheumatic effects develop in several weeks to months.  \\n \\nThe mechanism of action of DMARDs is that they subdue the proliferation and \\nactivation of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, thereby reducing their \\nability of causing joint inflammation and destruction. As j oint erosion is observed in \\n2 years of RA, the early use of DMARDs is suggested by many rheumatologists; but \\nthe toxicity and the loss of efficacy of DMARDs with time, limits the therapy. In few \\ncases, the patients should stop taking DMARDs within 5 years.  \\n \\n6.2.3.1.  Methotrexate (MTX ) \\nMethotrexate is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, and has immunosuppressant \\nand anti -inflammatory action. It is beneficial in RA as it inhibits cytokine \\nproduction, chemotaxis, and cell -mediated immune react ion. Low doses of MTX  \\n(7.5-15mg taken weekly via oral route) show s improved acceptability in RA. It has \\na rapid onset of action (4 -6 weeks), thus is the drug of choice for initial treatment. \\nMTX is considered the standard treatment for most patients, including juvenile RA.  \\n \\nMTX given orally has variable bioavailability, which is affected by the presence \\nof food in stomach. In patients having renal disease, its excretion is delayed (and \\nthus should be avoided in such patients).  \\n \\nMTX levels and toxicity is increased by probenec id and aspirin. Trimethoprim \\ninhibits dihydrofolate reductase and causes bone marrow depression.  \\n \\nNodulosis, oral ulceration, and GI upset are the major side effects of low dose \\nMTX regimen; while its prolonged therapy causes dose -dependent progres sive \\nliver damage which further leads to cirrhosis in some patients. Chest infection \\noccurs more commonly.

Azathioprine  \\nAzathioprine is a purine an timetabolite which converts into 6 -mercaptopurine \\nunder the influence of Thiopurine Methyl Transferase (TPMT) enzyme; and this \\nconverted form produces the relevant action. It suppresses cell -mediated \\nimmunity, inflammation, and also selectively affects the  differentiation and \\nfunction of T -cells and natural killer cells. Azathioprine in combination with \\ncorticosteroids produces a steroid sparing effect; and due to this effect it is used \\nwidely in cases with systemic manifestations.  \\n \\n6.2.3.3.  Sulfasalazine  \\nThe stru cture of sulfasalazine consis ts of sulfapyridine and 5 -amino salicylic acid. \\nThe compound is used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis and has anti -\\ninflammatory property. It can also be used in the treatment of RA.  \\n \\nIts mechanism of action is unknown; how ever the expected mechanism of action \\nis that sulfasalazine in colon breaks into its 2 parts by bacterial action, of which \\nsulfapyridine is systemically absorbed and is expected to be the active moiety. \\nThe drug is moderately effective in the treatment of RA, and its side effects are \\ncomparatively low.  \\n \\nThe common side effect is neutropenia or thrombocytopenia observed in 10% of \\nthe patients under this therapy. Hepatitis may also occur in some patients. The \\ndrug is used as the second line treatment and it is usually used in mild cases.  \\n \\n6.2.3.4.  Chloroquine  \\nChloroquine is basically an antimalarial drug, which can also be used in the \\ntreatment of RA. In the complete population of the people taking chloroquine, \\nhalf of the population respond positively to this drug. I t proves to be beneficial in \\ntreating morning stiffness and joint pain of RA. It also reduces the skin lesions of \\nlupus erythematosus.  \\n \\nThe mechanism of action of chloroquine is not completely known. It is expected \\nto exert its partial effect by inhibiting  the production of inflammatory mediators, \\nand also by inte rfering with the actions of leuk ocytes. The lymphocyte \\nproliferation is also inhibited by chloroquine.  The main organ affected by long \\nusage of chloroquine is eye, as the drug may cause corneal op acities and can \\neven cause serious retinal damage.  \\n \\n6.2.3.5.  Leflunomide  \\nLeflunomide is an immunomodulator which inhibits lymphocyte proliferation in \\npatients having active RA. It suppresses the arthritic symptoms and also retards \\nthe radiological progression of di sease. Its efficacy is comparable to that of MTX \\nand onset of action is also fast (4 weeks).  \\n \\nLeflunomide within the body gets rapidly converted into its active metabolite \\n(half-life  of 2 weeks), which inhibits dihydro -orotate dehydrogenase and \\npyrimidine synthesis in actively dividing cells. It may also depress the antibody \\nproduction by B -cells. Leflunomide is given in a loading dose of 100mg daily for \\n3 days followed by 20mg OD.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 167}),\n",

Gold Salts  \\nSodium  aurothiom alate and auranofin  are the two commonly used gold salts. \\nGold salts have been completely substituted with other DMARDs (methotrexate \\nspecifically). However, the gold salts are still being prescribed. The prescribers and \\ndispensers should know ab out the existence, uses, and adverse effects of gold salts. \\nTheir onset of action is slow, and produces maximum response after 3 -4 months of \\nthe therapy. They act by reducing the swelling of joints and also relieve the pain \\nand stiffness. Gold salts delay the progression of joint and bone damage.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nThe mechanism of action of gold salts is not known. The expected mechanism is \\nthat they inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, the release of chemical mediators of \\ninflammation, and a lso reduce the  migration of leuk ocytes in tissues.  \\n \\nTherapeutic Use  \\nSodium aurothiomalate is used in active progressive RA and in progressive \\njuvenile chronic arthritis. Auranofin is also used in active progressive RA when \\nthe effect produced by the NSAIDs alone is insu fficient.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nAbout 1/3rd of the patients taking gold salts, develop these serious adverse \\neffects, which may also require the withdrawal of therapy:  \\n1) Itching and rashes on skin which progresses to exfoliation; thus the treatment \\nis stopped,  \\n2) Renal damage,  \\n3) Bone marrow suppression, thus blood counts should be checked weekly, and \\nthe patient should inform the doctor in case of bleeding, bruising or sore throat,  \\n4) Stomatitis, and  \\n5) Dose -relate d diarrhoea caused by auranofin;  this is controlled by takin g high \\nfibre diet.  \\n \\n6.2.3.7.  Penicillamine  \\nPenicillamine has better effects when compared to other RA drugs, but the effect \\nproduced by methotrexate is much wide and expressive. Chemically , \\npenicillamine is a modified form of cysteine (amino acid), which interfere s with \\nthe action of enzymes attacking the joint proteins; thus suppresses inflammation.   \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\nThe mechanism of action of penicillamine (a good chelating agent) in RA is \\nindefinite. It acts by inhibiting the synthesis and release of IL -1, and synthesis of \\nDNA and mucopolysaccharide. It also prevents the maturation of newly \\nsynthesised collagen.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 168}),\n",

The serious adverse effects are  \\nthrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, renal damage, myosi tis, systemic lupus \\nerythematosus, skin rashes, and autoimmune disease.  \\n \\n6.2.4.  Biologic DMARDs  \\nAdalimumab  (Humira), Anakinra  (Kineret), Etanercept  (Enbrel), Infliximab  \\n(Remicade), and Rituximab  (MabThera) are the co mmonly used biologic \\nDMARDs. These are monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF -\\uf061. \\n \\nIntravenous infusions of infliximab  are given every 6 -8 weeks under hospital \\nsupervision. It is prescribed in combination with methotrexate, which suppresses \\nthe body’s i mmune response to infliximab. Subcutaneous injection of \\nadalimumab  is given once or twice weekly. Infliximab is associated with a \\nworsening of demyelinating disease.  \\n \\nEtanercept  is a fusion protein p75 TNF -\\uf061 receptor immunoglobulin which binds \\nto circulati ng TNF -\\uf061 and inactivates it. It is associated with bone marrow \\nsuppression. Anakinra  is a recombinant IL -R\\uf061-receptor antagonist which the \\npatients take daily on their own by subcutaneous route. It is prescribed in \\ncombination with methotrexate.  \\n \\nA newer cl ass of biologic DMARD is selective co -stimulation modulators . \\nAbatacept  is the first drug of this class, which selectively modulates the CD80 or \\nCD86 -28 co -stimulatory signal required for full T -cell modulation. These \\npreparations suppress the immune respo nse, and the treatment is discontinued in \\npatients with increased risk of sepsis or with diabetes.  \\n \\n6.2.5.  Corticosteroids  \\nCorticosteroids have potent immunosuppressant and anti -inflammatory activity. \\nThey can be in ducted at any stage in RA in combination with first or second line \\ndrugs, if potent anti -inflammatory action is required while continuing the NSAID \\nalong with  DMARD. They produce a quick symptomatic relief, but do not \\ncompletely halt the progression of RA;  however they slow down the joint \\ndestruction and bony erosions.  \\n \\nCorticosteroids used for long -term have some serious disadvantages; therefore, \\neither low doses (5 -10mg prednisolone or equivalent) are used to supplement \\nNSAIDs or high doses for short per iods are recommended in severe systemic \\nmanifestations (organ -threatening disease, vasculitis) while the patient awaits \\nresponse from a remission inducing drug.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 169}),\n",

Introduction and Basic Concepts i n Endocrine \\nPharmacology  \\nAll multicellular creatures require coordinating systems for regulating and \\nintegrating the function of differentiating cells. In higher ani mals, this function \\nis performed by the nervous and endocrine system s. The endocrine system acts \\nby releasing chemical agents (usually in the blood) and is important for the \\nproper development and functioning of organisms . The integration of \\ndevelopmental events like cellular proliferation, growth and differentiation, and \\nalso the management of respiration, movement, sensory perception, \\nreproduction, metabolism, and excretion  depend on “chemical cues”. These \\nchemical cues are synthesis ed and secreted by spe cial cells present in the \\nanimal -endocrine cells.  \\n \\nHormones control the following major physiologic processes :  \\n1) Growth and maturation,  \\n2) Intermediary metabolism, and  \\n3) Reproduction.  \\n \\nEndocrinology  is a branch of a broader field of internal medicine,  and is the \\nstudy of disorders of endocrinal glands. The basics of endocrinology have \\nevolved from the studies of hormone action. Many characteristics of \\ntranscriptional regulation and concepts of intracellular signalling and receptors \\nare vital components of this  field. Endocrinology is eventually the study of \\nintercellular communication.  \\n \\nTypically , hormones mediate the communication between the organs, as \\ndemonstrated by the effect of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) on kidney or bone. \\nSometimes, communication happens within the same tissue, as demonstrated by \\nautocrine (acting on the same cell) and paracrine (acting on the neighbouring \\ncells) actions  of Insulin -like Growth Factor -1 (IGF -1).  \\n \\nThe endocrine system  comprises  of glands which secrete a type of hormone  \\nfor regulating the body  functions . The endocrine system is an informal signal \\nsystem similar to the nervous system. Various functions of an organism like \\ngrowth , development, metabolism, tissue function, and mood are regulated by \\nhormones.

Hormones  \\nThe word hormone  has originated from a Greek word hormaein  which means to \\nimpel . Thus, hormone is a substance which is secreted by specialised cells and \\ntransported to a distant site to exert its action upon specific tissues. Hormones are \\nsynthesi sed and discharged by endocrine  glands directly into the blood circulation \\nwithout the intervention of duct s, therefore are also known as ductless glands . \\n \\nIf a hormone acts on other endocrine gland or tissue, it just stimulates or inhibits \\nits function.  \\n \\n7.1.3.  Classification  \\nHormones secreted by the endocrine or ductless glands are classified as follows:  \\n1) Pituitary  \\ni) Anterior Pituitary  \\na) Growth Hormone (GH , Somatotrophin ), \\nb) Prolactin (Prl) , \\nc) Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH, Corticotropin) , \\nd) Thyroid Stimulating Hormone  (TSH, Thyrotropin) , and  \\ne) Gonadotropins – Follicle Stimulating Hor mone (FSH) and \\nLuteinizing Hormone (LH)  \\nii) Posterior Pituitary  \\na) Oxytocin , and  \\nb) Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH, Vasopressin)  \\n2) Thyroid : Thyroxine (T 4), Triiodothyronine (T 3), and Calcitonin  \\n3) Parathyroid:  Parathormone (PTH)  \\n4) Pancreas:  Insulin and Glucagon  \\n5) Adrenals  \\ni) Cortex  \\na) Glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) , \\nb) Mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) , and  \\nc) Sex steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone) . \\nii) Medulla:  Adrenaline and  Noradrenaline  \\n6) Gonads  \\ni) Androgens (testosterone) , \\nii) Estrogen s (estradiol) , and  \\niii) Progestins (progesterone) . \\n \\n7.2. ANTERIOR PITUITARY H ORMONES  \\n \\n7.2.1.  Introduction  \\nPituitary is an essential glan d of the body and  is generally called as the master \\ngland . It is attached to the base of the brain by a thin stalk and sits in a bony \\nhollow pituitary fossa , which  is located behind the bridge of nose, below the \\nbase of brain, and close to the optic nerves. Pituitary gland produces hormones \\nwhich control many functions of other endocrine glands , thus  it is considered the \\nmost important part  of the endocrine system.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 173}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='174 Pharmacology -II  \\n*  * Pituitary gland is divided into the following  three  sections : \\n1) Anterior Lobe (Adenohypophysis):  This lobe has two portions,  i.e., the \\npars distalis  (or the anterior pituitary itself) and the pars tuberalis , which \\nforms the pituit ary stalk by wrapping around the infundibular stem. The \\nanterior lobe is involved in sexual maturation, re production, and \\ndevelopment of body. The hormones produced by the anterior lobe  regulate  \\ngrowth  and stimulate t he adrenal and thyroid gland s, besides ovaries and \\ntestes. Prolactin, which allows new mothers to produce milk, is also \\nproduced by the anterior lobe . \\n2) Intermediate Lobe:  This lobe produces a hormone which stimulate s the \\nmelanocytes , which are the cells that produce melanin to control \\npigment ation (skin colour) . \\n3) Posterior Lobe (Neurohypophysis):  This lobe has three sections, i.e.,  the \\nmedian eminence  (a neural tissue of hypothalamus from which the pituitary \\nprotrudes ), the posterior pituitary  itself, and the infundibular stem  (which \\nconnects both ). The posterior lobe produces antidiuretic hormone which \\nretrieves water from the kidneys and preserves it in the bloodstream for \\npreventing dehydration. Oxytocin, which assists in uterine contractions \\nduring childbirth and also stimulates the production and release of milk, is \\nalso produced by the posterior lobe.  \\n \\nHormones Secreted by Pituitary Gland  \\nCollectively, the  lobes of pituitary gland secrete various  hormones, which affect  \\nmany function s of the body. For example, the anterior pituitary produces five \\nprotein and polypeptide hormones ( table 7.1). \\n \\nTable 7.1: Hormones Secreted by the Pituitary Gland  \\nHormone s  Function s \\n1) Anterior Pituitary   \\ni) Growth Hormone (GH)  Stimulate s cell growth;  primary targets are \\nmuscle and bone, where GH stimulates \\namino ac id uptake and protein synthesis;  also \\nstimulates fat breakdown in the body.  \\nii) Thyroid -Stimulating Hormone \\n(TSH)  Stimulates release of thyroxine and tri -\\niodothyronine.  \\niii) Adrenocorticotropic Hormone \\n(ACTH)  Stimulates secretion of hormones by the \\nadrenal cortex , especially glucocorticoids.  \\niv) Gonadotropins (FSH and LH)  Stimulates gamete production and hormone \\nproduction by the gonads.  \\nv) Prolactin  Stimulates milk production by the breast.  \\n2) Intermediate Lobe   \\nMelanocyte -Stimulating Hormone \\nMSH)  Function in humans i s unknown.  \\n3) Posterior Pituitary   \\ni) Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)  Stimulates water re -absorption by nephrons \\nof the kidney.  \\nii) Oxytocin  Stimulates ejection of milk from breasts and \\nuterine contractions during birth.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 174}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Pharmacol ogy of Drugs Acting on Endocrine System - I (Chapter 7)  175 \\n*  * 7.2.2.  Growth Hormone (Somatotropin)  \\nGrowth Hormone (GH) is a protein -based , 191-amino acid , single -chain \\npolypeptide hormone , which stimulates growth and cell reproduction and \\nregeneration in humans and other animals . It is synthesised, stored, and secreted \\nby the somatotroph cells pr esent in the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary.  \\n \\nThe growth hormone  produced natively and naturally in animals is termed \\nsomatotropin , whereas, the growth hormone  produced by recombinant DNA \\ntechnology is termed  somatropin  (abbreviated as rhGH in hum ans). \\n \\n7.2.2.1.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nThe production of GH is modulated by exercise, nutrition, stress, sleep , and the \\nhormone itself. But, two hypothalamus hormones and one hormone from the \\nstomach are its major r egulators:  \\n1) Growth Hormone -Releasing Hormone (GHRH):  It is hypothalamic \\npeptide which stimulates the synthesis and secretion of growth hormone.  \\n2) Somatostatin (SS):  It is a  peptide \\nproduced by many body  tissues, \\nincluding hypothalamus. In response \\nto GHRH  and othe r stimulatory \\nfactors  (like low blood glucose \\nconcentration ), somatostatin inhibits \\nthe release  of GH .  \\n3) Ghrelin:  It is a peptide hormone \\nsecreted from the stomach. It binds to \\nthe receptors on somatotrophs and \\nstimulates GH secretion.  \\n \\nSecretion of GH is a  part of a negative feedback loop that involves IGF -1. High \\nlevels of IGF -1 in blood decrease GH secretion by suppressing the somatotroph \\ndirectly and by stimulating the release of somatostatin from hypothalamus.  \\n \\nGH also feeds back for inhibiting the secretion of GHRH , and has a direct \\n(autocrine) inhibitory effect on the secretions from the somatotroph.  \\n \\nA pulsatile pattern of release is formed when all the factors affecting the \\nsynthesis and secretion of GH are integrated. The basal concentration s of GH are \\nvery low in blood. In children and young adults, the period of GH release is just \\nafter the onset of deep sleep.  \\n \\nThe major regulators of  GH secretion by somatotrophs are the peptides released \\nby neurosecretory nuclei of hypothalamus ( GHRH and somatostatin) in  the portal \\nvenous blood surrounding the pituitary.  \\n \\nThough the balance of these stimulating and inhibiting peptides regulate the \\nrelease of GH, still the balance is affected by various inhibitors of GH secretion \\n(e.g., free fatty acids) a nd physiological stimulators ( e.g., nutrition, sleep, and \\nexercise).   \\nHypothalamus  \\nGHRH  SS –  +  \\n– + \\nPituitary  \\nGrowth \\nHormone  \\nLiver, etc. \\nIGF-1 +  –  + –  \\nGhrelin from \\nstomach  \\nFigure 7.1: Regulation of Growth \\nHormone Secretion', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 175}),\n",

Physiological Actions  \\nGrowth hormone has the f ollowing physiological actions:  \\n1) It controls balanced growth.  \\n2) It stimulates the production of hepatic somatomedins having anabolic activity . \\n3) It stimulates protein synthesis in skeletal mu scles and regulates the growth of \\nbones.  \\n4) It increases insulin secretion in hyperglycaemic conditions .  \\n5) It induces lipolysis.  \\n6) It‟s some effects are similar to that of prolactin . \\n \\n7.2.2.3.  Growth Hormone Analogues  \\nGiven below are the analogues of  growth hormone : \\n1) Peptide Hormones  \\ni) Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH ) binding to the Growth \\nHormone Releasing Hormone Receptor (GHRHR).  \\nii) Ghrelin binding to the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Re ceptors (GHSR).  \\n2) Sex Hormones  \\ni) Androgen is secreted excessively  from testis in males and from adrenal \\ncortex in females during puberty.  \\nii) Oestrogen.  \\n3) Clonidine and L -DOPA by stimulating GHRH release,  \\n4) Hypoglycaemia, arginine and propranolol by inhibiting somato statin release,  \\n5) Deep sleep,  \\n6) Fasting, and  \\n7) Vigorous exercise.  \\n \\n7.2.2.4.  Growth Hormone Inhibitors  \\nGrowth hormone secretion is inhibited by the following:  \\n1) Somatostatin:  It is a 14 amino acid peptide that can inhibit the secretion of  \\nGH, TSH, and prolactin from pituitary gland. It also inhibits the secretion of \\ninsulin and glucagon form  pancreas, and gastrointestinal secretions (such as \\ngastrin and HCl ). As a side effect , the GI action produces diarrhoea, \\nsteatorrhea, dyspepsia, nause a, and hypochlorhydria. Somatostatin causes \\nconstriction of  hepatic, splanch nic, and renal blood vessels. The reduced GI \\nmucosal blood can be used for controlling bleeding oesophageal varices and \\nbleeding pe ptic ulcer;  however, nowa days octreotide is prefe rred as it has a \\nlonger duration of action, i t has an adjuvant value in diabetic ketoacidosis (by \\ninhibiting glucagon and GH secretion) , it can be used for reducing \\ncomplications after pancreatic surgery, and it is helpful in pancreatic, biliary \\nor intesti nal fistulae due to its anti -secretory action .    \\n \\nSomatostatin is limitedly  used in acromegaly due to its short duration of \\naction ( half-life is  2-3 minutes) and lack of selectivity to only inhibit GH \\nsecretion and GH rebound on discontinuation.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 176}),\n",

It is administered parenterally \\n(subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously) as it is poorly absorbed \\nfrom the gut.    \\nUses: Octreotide is used for the symptomatic treatment of  carcinoid \\nsyndrom e, acute variceal bleeding,  acromegaly, and p olycystic diseases of \\nliver and kidney.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects:  The adverse effects of octreotide include nausea, gall \\nstones (due to biliary stasis) abdominal pain, and steatorrhoea.  \\n \\n7.2.2.5.  Growth Hormone Abnormalities  \\nLack of growth hormone or defects in its binding with receptors is called as \\ngrowth retardation  or dwarfism . The effects of GH deficiency depend  on \\nthe age of onset of disorder and can occur due to heritable or acquired  \\ndisease.  \\n \\nThe effects of excessive secretion of GH  also depend  on the age of onset and \\nmay give rise to the following two  disorders:  \\n1) Gigantism: It occurs due to excessive GH secretion  in young children . It \\noccurs occasional ly due to a tumour of somatotr opes.  \\n2) Acromegaly:  It occurs due to excessive GH secretion  in adults , generally \\ndue to benign pituitary tumours. The s ymptoms of acromegaly include soft -\\ntissue swelling, overgrowth of extremities, abnormalities in jaw structure, \\nand cardiac disease s.  \\n \\nTrea tment: The symptoms of GH abnormalities  can be improved by surgery, \\nirradiation, and by using  L-dopa  and bromocriptine  that suppress  GH secretion \\n(stimulate GH secretion in normal subjects).

It acts as LH, \\nand is therapeutically used as an injection after partial purification.  \\n \\nThe FSH in males  stimulates spermatogenesis, and the LH which is similar to the \\nInterstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone (ICSH) stimulates the testicular Leydig \\ncells for producing testosterone.  \\n \\n7.2.5.1.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nHypothalamus produces a single releasing factor (decapeptide designated GnRH) \\nthat stimulates the syn thesis and release of FSH and LH from pituitary. Thus, it is \\nalso called as FSH/LH -RH or LHRH  or gonadorelin . It has been suggested that \\nthe amplitude and frequency of GnRH pulses decides the amount of LH or FSH \\nor both that will be secreted. This is becau se GnRH is secreted in pulses and the \\namplitude and frequency of pulses changes during follicular (high frequency, low \\namplitude) and luteal (low frequency, high amplitude) phases.  \\n \\nThe feedback regulation of FSH and LH may also differ. Generally, the feedback \\ninhibition of LH is more noticeable than that of FSH. In females, secretion of \\nFSH and LH from  hypothalamus is inhibited by estradiol and progesterone, and \\nalso by direct action on pituitary. But, the LH and FSH secretion is also \\nstimulated by the pre-ovulatory rise in estrogen level . There are other regulatory \\nsubstances  also, such as inhibin  (a peptide from ovaries and testes that inhibits \\nFSH release ) and dopamine  (that inhibits LH release ). GnRH acts on \\ngonadotropes through a G -protein coupled rece ptor acting by increasing \\nintracellular Ca2+ by PIP 2 hydrolysis .  \\n \\nAt puberty, gonadotropin  secretion elevates and is higher in women than in men. \\nThe levels of LH and FSH remains almost constant (LH>FSH) in men , while \\nthey fluctuate in menstruating women.  In the follicular phase, low levels of LH \\nand moderate levels of FSH  are seen . Just before ovulation, the levels of LH \\nincreases , followed by a gradual fall in the  luteal phase. Due to loss of feedback \\ninhibition by sex steroids and inhibin, the levels of gonadotropins are high in \\nmenopausal women . \\n \\n7.2.5.2.

Due to fast enzymatic degradation, it \\nhas short plasma half-life (4-8 minutes) . It is also used for testing pituitary -\\ngonadal axis in males and hypogonadism  in females .   \\n2) Superactive/Long -Acting GnRH Agonists: Many analogues of GnRH have \\nbeen developed , e.g., Buserelin, Goserelin, Leuprolide, Nafarelin, Triptorelin. \\nThese are 15 -150 times more potent than natural GnRH and act longer ( half-life is  \\n2-6 hours) due to  resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis and  high affinity for GnRH.  \\n \\nNasal sprays or  subcutaneous  injections of super active GnRH agonists  are \\nused. As a result, a reversible pharmacological oophorectomy/orchiectomy is \\nproduced which is used in prostatic carcinoma, endomet riosis, \\npremenopausal breast cancer, precocious puberty, polycystic ovarian  disease , \\nuterine leiomyoma , and to support induced ovulation. It can also be used as a \\ncontraceptive in both males and females.   \\n3) Nafarelin: It is a long -acting GnRH agonist and is 150 times more effective \\nthan the natural GnRH. Within 10 days, down regulation of pituitary GnRH \\noccurs and peak inhibition of gonadotropin  release is achieved in a month. Its  \\nplasma half -life is 2 -3 hours.

It has \\narginine in most of the  species  and is also called Arginine Vasopressin  (AVP) or \\nargipressin . It retains water and constricts  blood vessels. Water retention in body is \\ncontrolled by vasopressin that increases  water reabsorption in the collecting ducts  of \\nkidneys  (tubules which coll ects the dilute urine produced by the nephrons) .  \\n \\nMagnocellular ce lls of the hypothalamus produce  vasopressin . These cells contain \\nosmoreceptors which sense  differences in extracellular osmolality. Secretion of \\nvasopressin from the nerve terminals in post erior pituitary is stimulated by elevated \\nosmolality. Vasopressin binds to V1 and V 2 receptors.  The former  are located in \\nsystemic arterioles and mediate va soconstriction, while the latter  are located in \\nnephron s and increases water reabsorption in the col lecting duct by stimulating cell \\nsurface expression of water channels. These two actions of vasopressin add up to \\nmaintain vascular tone by increasing blood pressure  and water reabsorption.  \\n \\n7.3.2.1.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nPosterior pituitary gland secretes vasopressin due to reduced plasma volume, \\nincreased plasma osmolality, and secretion of  cholecystokinin (CCK) by the \\nsmall intestine:  \\n1) The pressure receptors (baroreceptors) in the ve ins, atria, and carotid sinuses \\nstimulate the secretion of  vasopressin in response to reduced plasma volume.  \\n2) The osmoreceptors of hypothalamus stimulate the secretion of vasopressin in \\nresponse to elevated plasma osmotic pressure.  \\n3) Increased plasma CCK stimulates the  secretion of vasopres sin by an \\nunknown pathway.  \\n \\nThe neurons making AVP in the hypothalamic Supraoptic Nuclei (SON) and \\nParaventricular Nuclei (PVN) are osmorecept ors, and they also collect  synaptic \\ninput from other osmoreceptors present  near the anter ior wall of the third ven tricle  \\n(organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the sub -fornical organ ).  \\n \\nThe following  factors influence the secretion of vasopressin:  \\n1) Ethanol blocks the voltage -gated calcium channels present in \\nneurohypophyseal nerve terminal in rats, thus decreases the calcium -\\ndependent secretion of AVP .  \\n2) Angiotensin  II increase s AVP secretion and maintains its general pressor and \\npro-volumic effects on the body.  \\n3) AVP secretion is inhibited by atrial natriuretic peptide , partially by inhibiting \\nthe stimulation o f AVP secretion induced by angiotensin II.  \\n \\n7.3.2.2.

Iodothyronamine (T 1a) and thyronamine (T 0a) are \\nproduced by processing of T 4 and T 3 through decarboxylation and deiodination. \\nDietary selenium is important for T 3 production , as all three isoforms of \\ndeiodinases enzymes contain  selenium.   \\n \\nThyroid hormone r eceptors are theoretically similar to the steroid hormone \\nrecep tors.

Anti -Thyroid Drugs - Propylthiouracil  \\nAnti-thyroid drugs  are used to lower the functional capacity of the hyperactive \\nthyroid gland.  Propylthiouracil, also known  as 6-n-Propylthiouraci l (PROP), is a \\nthioamide drug which is indicated in hyperthyroidism (including Grave‟s disease). \\nIt reduces the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\n1) Central: Propylthiouracil  inhibits thyroperoxidase enzyme , which oxidises  \\nthe anion iodide (I–) to iodine (I0) during thyroid hormone synthesis, assisting \\nthe addition of iodine to tyrosine residues present on the hormone precursor \\nthyroglobulin. This is one of the major steps in thyroxine (T 4) production.  \\nThe sodium -dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cell‟s \\nbasolateral membranes is not inhibited by propylthiouracil . Competitive \\ninhibitors (like perchlorate and thiocyanate ) are required to inhibit this step.  \\n2) Peripheral: Propylthiouracil  also inhibits 5'-deiodinase  enzyme , which \\nconverts T4 into the active T 3.  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nPropylthiouracil  on oral administration reaches the p eak serum concentration in \\none hour, with extreme concentration in thyroid gland. But, due to many patient \\nvariables, euthyroid  status may not be attained within 2 -4 months after initiating \\nthe therapy.  \\n \\nUses  \\n1) Propylthiouracil is used for treating overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). It \\nacts by inhibiting the thyroid  gland from synthesising excess thyroid hormone . \\n2) It is preferred in patients who cannot tolerate methimazole and in whom \\nradioactive iodine therapy or surgery are not suitable for the management of \\nhyperthyroidism.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nThe possible side effec t of propylthiouracil is agranulocytosis (WBC  count \\ndecreases ). The symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions \\nof the throat, gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and \\nfever. Propylthiouracil may also cau se thrombocytopenia  (blood platelets decreases ). \\n \\n7.4.7.2.  Ionic Inhibitors  \\nThyroid traps iodide for T4/T3 synthesis .

Iodine  and Iodides  \\nIodine is the component of thyroid hormones but is also the fastest acting thyroid \\ninhibitor. In the intestine, the iodine molecules get reduced  to iodide and the \\nresponse given by iodine or iodides is same. Thus , the enlarged gland shrinks, \\nbecomes firm and less vascular.

Introduction  \\nThree hormones, calcitonin, Parathormone (PTH), and calcit riol (active form of \\nvitamin D) are wholly responsible for regul ating the plasma calcium levels . \\nThese hormones  control the intestinal absorption, exchange with bone, and renal \\nexcretion of plasma calcium. Many drugs, other hormones, and metabolites also \\ninfluence  calcium homeostasis.  \\n \\nThe plasma calcium level is 9 -11mg/dl, of which 40% is  bound to  plasma \\nprotein s (mainly albumin ), 10% forms an un -separable complex with phosphate, \\ncarbonate, and citrate , and the remaining 50% is ionised and physiologically \\nessential. For example, the total plasma calcium is low but the concentration of \\nCa2+ ion is normal in hypoalbuminemia . Ionisation of calcium is favoured by \\nacidosis and disfavoured by alkalosis. In deficient cases  of calcium, \\nhyperventilation reduces ioni sation and causes tet any and laryngospasm . \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nCalcium is absorbed from small intestine and duodenum through facilitated \\ndiffusion and carrier -mediated active transport  (under the influence of vitamin \\nD), respectively . Calcium forms an insolu ble complex in the intestines with \\nphytates, phospha tes, oxalates , and tetracyclines; this complex affects calcium \\nabsorption, which is also reduced by phenytoin and glucocorticoids .  \\n \\nThe ionised calcium undergoes glomerular filtration  and a major part of  it \\nundergoes tubular reabsorption . Proximal tubular reabsorption of calcium is \\nreduced by c alcitonin and enhanced by vitamin D , whereas its distal tubular \\nreabsorption is enhanced by PTH . Almost 300 mg of endogenous calcium  is daily \\nexcreted  half in urine and half in faeces. For maintaining calcium balance, the \\nsame amount of dietary calcium should  be absorbed in the small intestine. The \\ndiet should provide 0.8 -1.5gm/da y of calcium, as only 1/3rd of ingested calcium is \\nabsorbed. But, the fractional calcium absorption is increased due to calcium \\ndeficiency and low dietary calcium.  \\n  \\n7.5.2.  Parathormone  (Parathyroid Hormone, PTH)  \\nPTH is secreted by the  chief cells  of parathyroid glands. It is a polypeptide  \\ncontaining 84 amino acids . PTH plays a significan t role in bone remodelling  (a \\ncontinuous process involving alternate resorp tion and rebuilding of bone tissue \\nover time ). The bones serve  as a calcium reservoir  from which the body can \\nwithdraw cal cium  whenever need for maintaining sufficient amount of cal cium in \\nthe blood. PTH enables this removal of  calcium.  \\n \\nAs a resul t, PTH is important for health; and the health problems that result in \\ndeficient or excessive production of  PTH (like hyperparathyroidism, \\nhypoparathyroidism, or paraneoplastic syndromes) can cause bone disease, \\nhyperkalaemia, and hypocalcaemia.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 194}),\n",

Synthesis  \\nPTH  is produced as a 115 -amino acid polypeptide , called as pre-pro-PTH  (90 \\namino acids) that is later cleaved in the parathyroid cells at the N -terminal t o \\nyield pro-PTH (90 amino acids) and then PTH (84 amino acids). This obtained  \\nPTH is the major storage, biologically active, and secreted form of the hormone. \\nThis biosynthetic process takes less than an hour . The N-terminal cleaved pre-\\nsequence contains l arge amounts of hydrophobic amino acids, which are \\nimportant for transporting into endoplasmic reticulum, whereas, the basic pro -\\npeptide assists precise cleavage of pro -PTH into the mature  1-84 molecule. The \\nC-terminal of PTH is also important for the secr etory process of PTH. Few \\nseconds after the initiation of hypocalcaemia, PTH 1 -84 is secreted through \\nexocytosis. The synthesis and degradation of PTH is controlled by calcium .  \\n \\n7.5.2.2.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nLow e xtracellular concentration  of free calcium  stimulates  the release of PTH. \\nVariations in b lood phosphate concentration are related to the variations in PTH \\nsecretion. However, this is  an indirect effect as phosphate is not an important \\nregulator of PTH .  \\n \\nA sharp rise in the secretion of PTH  is \\nobserved when calcium concentration \\nfalls below the usual range . The levels \\nof hormone secreted are low also when \\nblood calcium levels are high . The \\ngraph  below depicts the release of \\nPTH from cells cultured in vitro  in \\ndifferent concentrations of calcium.  \\n \\nAn integral membrane protein functioning as a calcium -sensing receptor helps \\nthe parathyroid cell in monitoring extracellular free calcium concentration.  \\n \\n7.5.2.3.  Mechanism  of Action  \\nThe exact mechanism of PTH is unknown. It elevates the c AMP formation by \\nstimulating the activity of adenyl cyclase in the bone and ki dney cells. The \\ncAMP  is an essential factor which controls the intracellular calcium ion \\nconcentration.  \\n \\n7.5.2.4.  Physiological Actions  \\nPTH  increases the calcium level by stimulating the following  three processes:  \\n1) Mobilis ation of Calcium from Bone: Calcium is released in the blood  as \\nPTH stimulates the osteoclasts for reabsorbing bone mineral.  \\n2) Enhancing Absorption of Calcium from the Small Intestine : PTH \\nstimulates the  absorption of calcium from the small intestine to increase the  \\nblood calcium levels. However, PTH does this indirect ly by stimulating the \\nproduction of active form of vitamin D in the kidney s. This vitamin D in turn \\nstimulates production of a calcium -binding  protein i n intestinal epithelial \\ncells.

It is produced by parafollicular cells \\n(or C-cells) of the thyroid .  \\n \\nCalcium enters the bloodstream when the osteoclasts break down bone tissue. \\nCalcitonin controls calcium and potassium levels  by blocking this action of \\nosteoclast s. It also reduces the  amount of calcium in the blood by preventing  the \\nbreakdown of bone.  \\n \\n7.5.3.1.  Synthesis  \\nThe parafollicular cells surrounding  the \\nthyroid follicular cells  produce \\ncalcitonin.

Regulation of Secretion  \\nThe extracellular concentration of ionised calcium is the most important factor \\nwhich regulates calcitonin secretion. Increased blood c alcium levels stimulate \\ncalcitonin secretion and reduced blood calcium levels suppress calcitonin \\nsecretion .

Vitamin D Abnormalities  \\nVitamin D deficiency  is manifested by  rickets in children that leads to bone \\nabnormalities like b owed long bones, and o steomalacia in adults. Rickets and \\nosteomalacia occur  as a result of  insufficient exposure to sunlight and reduced \\ndietary intake of Vitamin D . These conditions  reduce the  mineralisation of newly  \\nsynthesis ed bone matrix. Vitamin D deficiency also occurs in the following  \\nsituations:  \\n1) Genetic D efects in Vitamin D Receptor:  Various mutations have been \\nrecognised in humans, which results in hereditary vitamin D resistance.  \\n2) Severe Liver or Kidney Disease:  This can affect the production  of the  \\nbiologically -active form of vitamin D.  \\n3) Insufficient Exp osure to Sunlight:  People not taking sufficient sunlight  and \\nhaving poor diets suffer from  a sub -clinical shortage of vitamin D .  \\n \\n7.5.4.9.  Vitamin D Toxicity  \\nExtreme  exposure to sunlight does not produce more vitamin D. Instead, \\noverdosing of vitamin D supplements  results in v itamin D toxicity. Some \\nvitamin D supplements are important for treating deficient individuals . But, \\nconsumption of excessive quantities of vitamin D (milligram) for weeks or \\nmonths can result in severe toxicity.  \\n \\n7.6.

The first phase is an initial \\nburst phase which reaches the peak  within minutes and declines quickly, and the \\nsecond slow phase reaches the peal in an hour.

Nearly 40% of the daily \\nproduced  insulin is damaged and only some part is excreted unchanged in urine.  \\n \\n7.6.2.4.  Mechanism of Action  \\nInsulin  acts by binding with high affinity and selectivity to several insulin \\nreceptors  present on cell membranes. The  formed  insulin -receptor complex enters \\nthe cell where insulin is released. The receptors differ inversely to insulin \\nconcentrations  in plasma . These receptors are reduced in number (down -\\nregulated)  during high concentration of insulin, while they are increased in \\nnumber  (up-regulated) during low concentration of insulin. This results in \\ndecreased and increased responsiveness to insulin, respective ly. \\n \\nOther than the number of receptors, their reduced affinity for insulin also add s to \\ninsulin resistance. Thus  in type II diabetes, reduced body weight can restore the \\nresponsiveness to insulin  produced within the body by up -regulating and \\nincreasing af finity for insulin by these receptors.

They act by binding to high affinity sulfonylurea receptors present on \\nthe \\uf062-cells related to ATP -sensitive potassium channel. This binding causes \\ndepolarisation due to inhibit ion of K+ ions. Consequently, a voltage -gated \\ncalcium channel is opened resulting in calcium efflux and release of insulin.  \\n \\nSerum glucagon level is reduced by chronic administration of sulfonylurea to \\ntype 2 diabetic patients; this adds up to the hypoglyc aemic effect of drug.  \\nSulfonylurea  also binds with comparatively less affinity to the receptors on \\nextrapancreatic tissues .  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\nAll sulfonylureas are well -absorbed on oral administration . 90% or more of \\nsulfonylureas  is plasma protein bound except glibenclamide.

Glucagon  \\nGlucagon  is a 29 amino acid , single chain polypeptide  released by the \\uf061-cells \\nof the islets of Langerhans in pancreas. It is produced from a 180 amino acid \\nprecursor known as pre-pro-glucagon . It acts opposite to insulin, thus increases \\nthe blood glucose levels.  \\n \\nWhen blood sugar (glucose) levels decrease too much, the pancreas releases \\nglucagon. In the presence of glucagon, liver converts the glycogen into glucose \\nand releases in the bloodstream. The release of insulin is stimulated by high \\nblood glucose levels. In sulin allows the uptake and use of glucose by the insulin -\\ndependent tissues. Th us, glucagon and insulin retain  the blood glucose at a stable \\nlevel, by being a part of feedback system.  \\n \\n7.6.4.1.  Synthesis  \\nGlucagon  is synthesised by the pancreatic α -cells as well as by the GIT (n early \\n1/3rd of the circulating glucagon ). When compared to other polypeptide hormones , \\nno noticeable change has been noticed in the structure of glucagon during \\nevolution . The sequence of pre -pro-glucagon depends o n the nucleotide sequence \\nof cloned cDNA, and its structure consists of a pre signal, a pro, N -terminal peptide \\nknown as Glicentin -Related Pancreatic Peptide (GRPP) , two carboxy terminal \\npeptides  known as Glucagon -Like Peptides (GLP -I and GLP -II), and gluc agon. \\nBoth GLP -I and GLP -II levels are raised after meal, similar to glucagon.  \\n \\n7.6.4.2.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nThe primary effect of glucagon is to raise the blood glucose levels;  it is \\nunderstandable that glucagon is re leased as a re sponse to hypoglycaemia.  Two \\nother conditions that trigger the secretion of glucagon are: \\n1) Elevated Blood Levels of Amino Acids (After Consumption of a Protein -\\nRich Meal):  In this condition, glucagon increases gluconeogenesis and \\nfacilitates  the conversion of excess amino acids into glucose. This will be a \\ncondition during which both insulin and glucagon are active , as insulin \\nrelease is stimulated by high blood levels of amino acids.  \\n2) Exercise:  It is unclear i f exercise is the real stimulus  or the associated \\nexercise -induced glucose depletion  is the main cause of glucagon secretion.  \\n \\nWith reference to negative control, high levels of blood glucose prevent glucagon \\nsecretion. It is unclear if this shows the direct effect of glucose on the α-cells, or \\nan effect of insulin that suppresses  glucagon release. Somatostatin is another  \\nhormone that inhibits  glucagon secretion.  \\n \\n7.6.4.3.  Mechanism of Action  \\nGlucagon binds to a glucagon receptor , which is a G-protein coupled receptor \\npresent on  the plasma membrane . This receptor goes through a conformational change \\nwhich activates adenylate cycl ase, when the G -protein and the receptor  interact .  \\n \\nAdenylate cyclase produces cAMP that activates  protein kinase A  enzyme  \\n(cAMP -dependent protein kinase) . This enzyme prod uces phosphorylase A \\nenzyme  that assists in releasing glucose -1-phosphate from glycogen polymers.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 213}),\n",

Physiological Actions  \\nThe major physiological actions  of glucagon include:  \\n1) Metabolic Effects: Glucagon infusion quickly increases the blood glucose \\nby incre asing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver. It stimulates \\nadenylyl cyclase in the adipose tissue and enhances lipolysis. Therapeutic \\ndoses of glucagon are responsible for releasing calcitonin from medullary \\ncarcinoma cells, insulin from normal p ancreatic cells, and catecholamines \\nfrom pheo chromocytoma. Glucagon is also important in the development of \\nketoacidosis.  \\n2) Cardiac Effects: Glucagon exerts potent inotropic and chronotropic effects \\n(mediated by the cAMP) on the heart . Therefore, its effect s are identical to \\nthose produced by \\uf062-adrenoceptor agonists, which require active \\uf062-receptors.  \\n3) Effects on Smooth Muscle s: High doses of glucagon produce deep \\nrelaxation in the intestines. As compared to the  other effects of peptide , this \\neffect on the int estines is because of the mechanisms not involving activation \\nof adenylyl cyclase.  \\n4) Other  Effects:   \\ni) Glucagon is the most effective glycogenolytic hormone that induces a \\nfast increase in blood glucose.  \\nii) In healthy people, it is the second defence against hypo glycaemia ; the \\nfirst is plasma insulin level reduction because of reduction in blood \\nglucose concentration. The latter one is not active in patients taking \\ninsulin or an oral hypoglycaemic drug .  \\niii) Glucagon stimulates lipolysis  in the peripheral tissues, whi ch further \\nstimulates ketogenesis. Glucagon also increases neoglucogenesis  when \\nglucocorticoids are available.  \\niv) It increases the release of insulin from β-cells, and it has been reported \\nthat it also takes part in the release of insulin following ingestion  of \\nglucose.  \\n \\n7.6.4.5.  Uses  \\nGlucagon is used in the following conditions :  \\n1) Severe Hypoglycaemia: It is mainly used during emergency treatment of \\nserious hypoglycaemic conditions in insulin -dependent patients. But, the \\ntreatment of choice for severe hypoglycaemia i s glucose and adrenaline  via \\nintravenous route . Glucagon currently is  used in 0.5 -1mg dose via \\nintravenous or intramuscular route . Nasal sprays have also been \\nmanufactured and are currently going through clinical trials.  \\n2) Endocrine Diagnosis: Many diagnost ic tests employ glucagon for \\ndiagnosing endocrine pathophysiologic processes:  \\ni) A standard test of pancreatic \\uf062-cell secretory reserve involving \\nadministration of  1mg of glucagon  as an intravenous bolus followed by \\nmeasurement of C-peptide in plasma of patie nts having insulin -\\ndependent diabetes mellitus .', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 214}),\n",

Glucagon Abnormalities  \\nDiseases related to excessive  or insufficient  release of glucagon are scarce. \\nUnnecessary glucagon secretion occurs due to  cancer of α-cells (glucagonomas). \\nGenerally, these tumours result  in wasting syndrome, rash es, and other skin \\nlesions.  Even though insulin deficiency is the major defect in type 1 diabetes \\nmellitus, there have be en enough studies which suggest  that the abnormal \\nsecretions of glucagon assists in metabolic imbalances related to  this disease.

Introduction  \\nACTH  is a polypeptide hormone  which controls the secretions of adrenal cortex \\nand is released by the chromophobe cells of pituitary gland. Cor ticotropin -\\nReleasing Hormone (CRH) is responsible for the production and release of \\nproopiomelanocortin (a peptide ) from hypothalamus.  ACTH  is produced by post -\\ntranslational processing of this precursor  polypeptide.  Other products include \\uf067-\\nmelanocyte -stimulating hormone and \\uf062-lipotropin  (the precursor of endorphins ). \\nGenerally, ACTH is released by the pituitary in pulses with a dominant diurnal \\nrhythm; the highest concentration occurs at almost 6  AM, and the lowest occurs \\nin the evening. ACTH  secretion is increased by stress and decreased by cortisol .   \\n \\n7.7.2.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nSecretion of  ACTH is controlled by  the hypothalamic Corticotropin -Releasing \\nFactor (CRF) that is released under the infl uence of emotion, stress, trauma, and \\ndiurnal rhythms.  CRF further stimulates the synthesis and release of ACTH . \\nVasopressin and catecholamine also stimulate ACTH secretion. On the other \\nhand, ACTH secretion is suppressed by adrenal corticosteroids (glucoc orticoids), \\neither by direct action or by inhibiting CRF release.  \\n \\nThe former is the short negative feedback loop , while  the latter  is the long \\nnegative feedback loop .

Introduction  \\nCorticosteroids  are the class of  steroid hormo nes that include  the hormones \\nsynthesised in the adrenal cortex of vertebrates, and the ir synthetic analogues. \\nThey have a large range of physiological processes such as stress response, \\nimmune response, and regulation of inflammation , carbohydrate  metabolism, \\nprotein catabolism, blood electrolyte  levels, and behaviour.   \\n \\nExamples  of some common natural corticosteroids  include corticosterone  \\n(C21H30O4), cortisone  (C21H28O5, 17 -hydroxy -11-dehydrocorticosterone), and \\naldosterone . \\n \\nTwo  types  of corticosteroids are:  \\n1) Glucocorticoids:  These  corticosteroids control carbohydrate, fat and protein \\nmetabolism. They show  anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting phospholipid  \\nrelease, reducing eosinophil  action , and by a number of other mechanisms.  \\n2) Mineralocorticoids:  These corticos teroids regulate the electrolyte and water \\nlevels by stimulating sodium retention in the kidney s. \\n \\n7.8.2.  Biosynthesis  \\nSteroid s are  synthesis ed mainly in the adrenal gland and also in the steroidogenic \\ncells of the brain, ov ary, testes, and placenta. The intra -mitochondrial distribution \\nof cholesterol is the rate -limiting  step in the synthesis  of steroid s and is facilitated \\nby Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR)  protein . P450cc is an enzyme that \\ncleaves cholesterol for prod ucing pregnenolone  (a common precursor for \\naldosterone and cortisol)  (figure 7.14).  \\n \\nThe biosynthetic pathways of both involve  various intermediates and enzymes to \\nbecome completely privileged at 11 -deoxycorticosteroid (aldosterone pathway) \\nand 11 -deoxyco rtisol (DOC; cortisol pathway ).  \\n \\nThe last step of cortisol synthesis is the conversion of DOC into cortisol in the \\npresence of 11β -hydroxylase (CYP11B1 gene) enzyme, whereas the last three \\nstages of aldosterone synthesis need aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2  gene) \\nenzyme. The differential spatial expressions of these enzymes in the cortex of the \\nadrenal gland are divided into three different zones:  \\n1) Zona glomerulosa,  \\n2) Zona fasciculate, and  \\n3) Zona reticularis.  \\n \\nCortisol is produced in the zona fasciculata, and a m inor amount of it is produced \\nby the nearby cells in the zona reticularis.

Glucocorticoids  (GCs ) \\nGlucocorticoids  are a class of steroid hormones found in almost all vertebrate \\nanimal cells. These hormones are synthesised in the adrenal cortex, having \\nsteroidal structure and act by binding to the Glucocorticoid Receptor s (GR).  \\n \\nGCs are the component of the feedback mechanism in the immune system that \\ndecreases the immune activity (inflammation). Hence, they are used for the \\ntreatment of diseases caused by an overactive immune system, e.g., allergies, \\nasthma, au toimmune diseases, and sepsis.  \\n \\nGCs have various diverse (pleiotropic) effects, including some harmful side \\neffects, and so they are rarely sold over -the-counter. They are used in high doses \\nin the treatment of cancer because they inhibit certain abnormal mechanisms in \\ncancer cells.  \\n \\n7.8.3.1.  Regulation of Synthesis  \\nThe production of glucocorticoid is regulated by HPA ( Hypothalamic -Pituitary -\\nAdrenal) axis  through ACTH ( figure 7.15). \\n \\nPoste rior pituitary synthesises ACTH \\nprimarily as a response to two synergistic \\nfactors , i.e., CRH and ADH, which are \\nproduced  in the paraventricular nucleus of \\nhypothalamus. These peptides are \\ntransported via neurohypophyse al stalk to \\nthe median eminence.  Then  they enter  the \\nportal circulation to stimulate  ACTH \\nrelease by binding to the CRF type 1 \\nreceptor or V 1b receptor , separately.   \\n \\nACTH increases the production of cortisol \\nin the adrenal. Cortisol produces negative \\nfeedback on the HPA axis by blocking the \\nsecretion and actions of CRH. ACTH also \\ninhibits its own secretion for producing a \\nshort -loop negative feedback.  \\n \\n7.8.3.2.  Mechanism of Action  \\nGlucocorticoids maintain protein synthes is by entering the target cells, \\nspecifically binding to the receptors in cell nuc leus, and stimulating the formation \\nof messenger RNA ( figure 7.16).

Pharmacokinetics  \\nThe synthetic glucocorticoids  are well-absorbed orally . They  bound either with \\ntranscortin, a globulin, or plasma albumin, for distribution  in the blood \\ncirculation. Levels of free active glucocorticoids  are reduced due to increased \\ntranscortin levels during pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, and by oestrogen and oral \\ncontraceptives . Similarly, low steroid doses  are required during malnutrition, \\nhypothyroidism, and reduced serum protein levels. Glucocorticoids are  \\nmetabolised in the liver , and the metabolites are excreted by kidneys. Systemic \\nabsorption occur s on topical administration  of glucocorticoids .  \\n \\n7.8.3.4.  Physiological Actions  \\nGlucocorticoids have the following physiological actions : \\n1) Intermediary Metabolism:  They  help in gluconeogenesis by increasing the \\nuptake of amino acid by the liver and k idney and promoting the activities of \\ngluconeogenic enzymes. They activate protein catabolism (except in the \\nliver) and lipolysis, thus providing  the building blocks and energy required \\nfor glucose synthesis.  \\n \\nDeficiency of glucocorticoid s can cause hypog lycaemia (during stressful \\nperiods or fasting conditions).

They also reduce protein \\nsynthesis by intervening in the nucleic acid metabolism. Excessive \\nglucocorticoids result  in osteoporosis, muscle wasting, high secretion of \\ncreatinine and uric acid in urine.  \\niii) Fat Metabo lism:  Glucocorticoids increase fat absorption from \\nintestine s, metabolise fat from depot , and break  it down into ketone \\nbodies in liver. Excessive glucocorticoids result in redistribution of fat in \\nthe body and hyperlipidaemia . \\n2) Stress:  Glucocorticoids increase the plasma glucose levels and provide \\nenergy required  to combat stress due to  trauma, fright, infection, bleeding, or \\ndebilitating disease. They improve  the vaso constrictor action of adrenergic \\nstimuli on small vessels.  \\n3) Blood Cells : Glucocorticoi ds reduce the  levels of eosinophils, basophils, \\nmonocytes, and lymphocytes in blood circulation by redistributing them from the \\ncirculation to lymphoid tissue.

The \\nconcentration  of transcortin is increased during pregnancy and by the use of oral \\ncontraceptives; thus, the corticoid levels in blood are increased, but \\nhypercorticism does not occur as free cortisol levels are normal.  \\n \\nCorticosteroids are mainly metabolised by hepatic microsomal enzyme s through \\nthe following p athways:  \\n1) Reduction of 4,5 -double bond an d hydroxylation of 3 -keto group,  \\n2) Reductio n of 20 -keto to 20 -hydroxy form, and  \\n3) Oxidative cleavage of 20C side chain (in case of compounds having a 17 -\\nhydroxyl group) to yield 17 -ketosteroids.  \\n \\nThe plasma half -life of hydrocortisone is 1.5 hours , but its biological half -life is \\nlonger due to its action through intracellular receptors and regulation of protein \\nsynthesis.

Physiological Actions  \\nFollowing are the physiological actions  of mineralocorticoids:  \\n1) Electrolyte and Water Metabolism:  Aldosterone enhances sodium \\nresorption and increases the excretion of potassium by the kidney, intestine s, \\nand sweat and salivary g lands. Patients suffering from an aldosterone \\nproducing adenoma (primary hyperaldosteronism), the subject leaks from the \\nsodium retaining effect; but potassium loss remains.  \\n \\nIn case of aldosterone deficiency, the distal renal tubule is unable to conserve \\nsodium and there is a significant sodium loss with related osmotic diuresis, \\ncausing decrease in plasma sodium.

As a result, water mov es into the cells causing \\nover-hydration. Contraction of the blood volume causes collapse and death.   \\nSimilar effects of aldosterone are seen on cellular sodium transport at other \\nsites, like intestines.  \\n \\n2) Cardiovascular Effects:  Aldosterone helps in blood coagulation, \\ncontraction of systemic arterioles, and stimulation of  thirst. It also control s \\nthe inflammatory and reparative processes t hat occur after tissue injury .  \\n \\n7.8.4.5.  Uses  \\nAldosterone and its synthetic derivatives ( e.g., fludroco rtisone) are used for \\ntreating Addison‟s disease, s alt losing  congenital adrenal  hyperplasia, \\nhyporeninemic  hypoaldosteronism as in chronic kidney disease due to dia betes \\nmellitus and other causes, and severe postural hypotension from autonomic \\nneuropathy of  any etiology . \\n \\n7.8.4.6.  Adverse Effects  \\nAdverse effects are related to the excessive s odium retaining and potassium \\ndepleting actions and also include weight gain, oedema, hypertension , and \\nhypokalaemia. Patients with Addison‟s disease are very sensitive to these effects , \\nand therefore the dose of a mineralocorticoid should be adjusted care fully.  \\n \\n7.8.5.  Corticosteroid Inhibitors  \\nGiven below are the different inhibitors of corticosteroids:  \\n1) Synthesis Inhibitors: These drugs are limitedly used in Cushing‟s syndrome \\nor adrenocortical tumours. They can cause acute a drenal insufficiency, if \\nthey are not cautiously monitored. Some examples  of drugs that inhibit  the \\nsynthesis of corticosteroids are:  \\ni) Metyrapone : 11β-hydroxylase enzyme  is inhibited by this drug, which \\nalso inhibits the production of glucocorticoids. It is used for testing \\nadrenal function.   \\nii) Trilostane : The synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and \\ngonadal hormones is inhibited by this drug.  \\niii) Aminoglutethimide : The synthesis of  all steroid hormones including sex \\nhormones is inhibited by this drug as it inhibit s the conversion of \\ncholesterol into pregnenolone. It is used in breast carcinoma.  \\niv) Ketoconazole:  The synthesis of adrenocorticoids and sex hormones is \\ninhibited by this drug. It is an orally efficient systemic antifungal which \\nis also used in prostate cancer.  \\nv) Mitotane : It exhibits  adrenolytic properties , and  has been used in \\nadrenal carcinoma.  \\n2) Receptor Antagonist: Mifepristone is a pr ogestero ne antagonist, \\nabortifacient, and  an antagonist at glucocorticoid receptors. It can decrease \\nthe consequences of glucocorticoids on hypothalamus and pituitary, and may \\nbe used efficient ly for treating Cushing‟s syndrome.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 225}),\n",

Introduction  \\nSex hormones are synthesised by the gonads. These hormones are required for \\nconception, embryonic maturation, and development of primary and secondary \\nsexual characteristics at the time of puberty. The activity of se x hormones on \\ntarget cells is regulated by the receptors.  \\n \\nTestosterone  is a sex hormone, responsible for sexual and reproductive growth  in \\nmales . It belongs to  a class of male hormones known as androgens  (or steroids or \\nanabolic steroids ). Testosterone t akes part in the growth of male sex organs before \\nbirth, and the growth of secondary sex characters at puberty, like voice deepening, \\nincreased size of penis and testes, and growth of facial and body hair.  \\n \\n8.1.2.  Androgens  \\nAndrogens are the  group of hormones that mainly affect the growth and \\ndevelopment of the male  reproductive system.  In this group of hormones, \\ntestosterone  is the most active and dominant androgen. It is mainly secreted in \\nmales by the Leydig cells in  their testes , and small amount of them is secreted by \\nthe adrenal glands  of both male and female.    \\n \\nApart from testosterone, other androgens are:  \\n1) Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA):  It is a steroid hormone that is produc ed \\nfrom cholesterol in the adrenal cortex. It is the main precursor of natural \\nestrogens. It is also known as dehydroisoandrosterone or \\ndehydroandrosterone.  \\n2) Androstenedione (Andro):  It is an androgenic steroid that is synthesised by \\nthe ovaries, adrenal c ortex, and cortex. Androstenediones form  the parent \\nstructure of estrone when gets  metabolically converted into testosterone and \\nother androgens.  \\n3) Androstenediol:  It is a steroid metabolite that acts as a controller of \\ngonadotropin secretion.  \\n4) Androsterone : It is a  chemical by -product of androgens  or a derivative  of \\nprogesterone that  produces minor masculinis ing effects. It is found  in almost \\nequal amounts in the plasma and urine of both males and females.  \\n5) Dihydrotestosterone (DHT):  It is a metabolite of t estosterone, and an \\nandrogen with more potency than testosterone as it binds more strongly to \\nandrogen receptors .

Classification  \\nAndrogens are classified in to two classes:  \\n1) Naturally Occurring Androgens : Testostero ne, Dihydrotestosterone,  \\nDehydroepiandrosterone, and  Androsterone.  \\n2) Synthetic Androgens : Methyl testosterone,  Fluoxymesterone,  Testosterone \\nundecanoate, and  Mesterolone.  \\n \\n8.1.2.2.  Synthesis  \\nThe production of male hormones and sperm is co ntrolled by the pituitary gland \\nand hypothalamus. Luteinising hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone \\n(FSH) are the two essential  messenger hormones produced by the pituitary gland \\nwhich act on the testes. LH is required by the Leydig cells in the te stes for \\nproducing testosterone. This  testosterone along with the  FSH acts on the \\nseminiferous tubules (sperm -producing tubes) for producing sperm  (figure 8.1). \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n8.1.2.3.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nTestoste rone is released by the interstitial (Leydig) cells of the testes through the \\neffect of pulsatile secretion of LH from pituitary. FSH mainly promotes \\nspermatogenesis in tubular (Sertoli) cells. The mediator of feedback relationship \\nwith pituitary is not kn own; but the high concentration of testosterone prevents \\nthe release of LH and also causes degeneration of interstitial cells, but has weak \\naction on the release of FSH.  \\n \\nEstrogens have a more strong inhibitory action on gonadotropin secretion in \\nmales. Th e minute amount of estradiol produced by testes and that obtained by \\nthe conversion of testosterone to estradiol is essential for feedback inhibition. \\nInhibin (a protein synthesised by Sertoli cells) has a potential of FSH inhibition \\nand may also mediate f eedback inhibition. Pituitary is directly acted upon by \\ntestosterone and estradiol, which also acts on the hypothalamus to reduce the \\nsecretion of GnRH ( figure 8.2).  \\nSperm tubule  Leydig cell  Testos terone  Hypothalamus  \\nPituitary  \\nSperm  \\nTestis  FSH LH \\nFigure 8.1: Synthesis of Male Hormones  hypothalamus\\npituitary\\ntestis', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 230}),\n",

Mechanism of Action  \\nAndrogens enter the target tissues of cell \\ncytoplasm by simple diff usion through the cell \\nmembrane. The androgens bind to and activate \\nthe androgen receptors in the cell. The \\nandrogen -receptor complex attaches to a \\nparticular DNA site and stimulates the \\nsynthesis of messenger RNA, which further \\nstimulates the production o f enzymes and \\nproteins essential for affecting androgen action.  \\n \\n8.1.2.5.  Pharmacokinetics  \\nTestosterone is well -absorbed on oral \\nadministration,  and is mostly inactivated by \\nthe liver ; therefore , it is therapeutically \\nuseless. Its 17 -methyl derivatives (i.e., \\nmeth yltestosterone and fluoxymesterone ) are \\nvery less degraded by the liver and are orally \\nefficient.  98% of testosterone is plasma \\nprotein bound and 2% remains free. It has a  \\nplasma half -life of 10-20 minutes. It is \\nmostly metabolised in the liver  and is \\nexcreted through urine  as androsterone, \\netiocholanolone, sulfates , and glucuronides. The plasma testosterone levels are \\nessential for determining the amount of androgen synthesis ed in male s.  \\n \\n8.1.2.6.  Physiological Actions  \\nPhysiological actions of androgens are given below:  \\n1) They  stimulate the development of sex organ s (androgenic) like the seminal \\nvesicle , the external genitalia , and secondary sexual characters ( e.g., pubic, \\naxillary hair growth, beard, moustache, and body hair) in male s.  \\n2) They maintain  the life and fe rtility of spermatozoa.  \\n3) They are responsible for the denser and stronger (anabolic) bony structure  in \\nmales . They are also involved in the muscular development by stimulating \\nprotein metabolism.  \\n4) Due to the anabolic effects of testosterone the blood volume  and RBC s \\nbecome more in male s. \\n5) Libido is stimulated in males.  \\n \\n8.1.2.7.  Uses  \\nThe uses of androgens are given below : \\n1) Testicular Failure: Primary testic ular failure occurs in children, causes \\ndelayed puberty, and can be treated with p arenteral testosterone esters or  \\ntransdermal testosterone/dihydrotestosterone used for 4-6 months. Secondary \\ntesticul ar failure occurs later in life and causes  as loss of libido and \\nimpotence. It can be treated  with androgen s.

Androgen Abnormalities  \\nThe a dverse reactions or abnormalities related to androgens are:  \\n1) Large dose of testosterone causes precocious puberty  in boy s, and \\nmasculinis ation  (deepening of voice, hirsutism, acne, baldness , and \\nclitoromegaly) in girls. Some of these effects  are irreversible.  \\n2) Continuous use  of large doses  of these drugs cause early closure of the \\nepiphyses , and therefore stop s growth  in you ng children . \\n3) Androgens can cause gynecomastia  in boys at the time of  puberty.  \\n4) Large doses of androgens in adult males decrease spermatogenesis  and \\ncause degeneration of seminiferous tubules . \\n5) Androgens intensify a pre-existing prostate cancer . They also int ensify \\nbladder neck obstruction in patients having benign prostatic hypertrophy.  \\n6) Large doses of androgens result in sodium  retention and oedema . \\n7) Several anabolic steroids, methyl testosterone, and fluoxymesterone are \\nhepatotoxic and result in cholestatic j aundice . \\n8) Aplastic anaemia patients undergoing continuous treatment with 17 -alkyl \\nderivatives suffer from hepatic adenocarcinoma .  \\n9) Indications of androgen deficiency  (low testosterone)  include low energy \\nlevels, low sex drive, irritability, mood swings, poo r concentration , and \\ndecreased muscle strength.

This reserved \\nnitrogen is combined into amino acids and protein , and results in  development, \\nregeneration and hypertrophy of body tissue s. This is clinically demonstrated by \\nmuscle mass and body weight.  \\n \\nAnabolic androgen s are not efficient during the acute phases of diseases marked \\nby protein catabolism. They only enhance protein sy nthesis  and tissue repair . \\n \\nAnabolic steroids antagonise the protein wasting effects  of extended \\nglucocorticoid treatment and also prevent bone resorption.  \\n \\n8.1.3.2.  Uses  \\nThe conditions requiring anabolic steroids for their treatment include:  \\n1) Catabolic States:  Nega tive nitrogen balance lead s to acute illness, severe  \\ntrauma, major surgery , etc. Anabolic steroids decrea se nitrogen loss for \\nshort -term, but its long-term effects  are uncertain.  \\n2) Renal Insufficiency:  Anabolic steroids decrease urea production and lower  \\nthe frequency of dialysis required in renal failure.  \\n3) Osteoporosis:  In elderly males, osteoporosis  arising because of continuous \\nimmobilisation responds to anabolic steroids , but currently bisphosphonates \\nare preferred .  \\n4) Suboptimal Growth in Boys:  Use of anab olic steroids is debatable in this \\ncase, and somatotropin is a better option. Short outburst in linear growth \\ncan be induced by anabolic  steroids but this does not create a difference in \\nthe final size, excluding hypogonadism. It should not be used for 6 months  \\nonly, or else  premature closure of epiphyses and limitation of final size  \\nmay occur . \\n5) Hypoplastic, Haemolytic, and Malignancy Associated Anaemia:  Most of \\nthe patients show  an increase in RBC count and haemoglobin .

Introduction  \\nThe three main types of female sex hormones are:  \\n1) Estrogen : It is synthesised  by the ovaries, body fat (in small amounts), and  \\nadrenal gland. It is helpful in maintaining calcium in bones, regulating  the \\nbalance of High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Low Density Lipoprotein \\n(LDL) cholesterol in blood, and maintaining memory functions, blood sugar \\nlevels, and emotional balance.  \\n2) Progesterone : It is synthesised in huge quantities during an d after ovulation. It \\nmakes the uterus suitable for implantation of a fertilised egg. It also reduces  \\nbody fat, assists in relaxing and reducing anxiety, and enhances hair growth.  \\n3) Testosterone : It is the main sex hormone in males,  however  is also \\nsynthesised in small amounts in females by the ovaries and adrenal glands. It \\nis essential in health and well -being. It influences mood, libido, energy, and \\nbody fat. It also provides protection against osteoporosis.  \\n \\n8.2.2.  Estrogens  \\nThe primary female sex hormone s are estrogens  (or oestrogens ) which are \\nresponsible for the development and control of reprodu ctive system  and \\nsecondary sex characteristics in females. Any natural or synthetic substance that \\nmimics the effects of the natural hormone  is categorised under oestrogens. The \\nmost poten t and prevalent endogenous estrogen is 17β-estradiol  (a steroid ) \\nwhile many estradiol  metabolites also have the estrogenichormonal activity.  \\n \\nEstrone (E1) , estradiol (E2) , and estriol (E3)  are the examples of three main \\nnaturally occurring estrogens  in w omen. Estetrol  (E4) is the other type of \\nestrogen that is formed during pregnancy. Small amount of estrogens are also \\nfound in males which perform some critical physiological roles.  \\n \\n8.2.2.1.  Classification  \\nEstrogens are classified as given below:  \\n1) Natural Estrogens  \\ni) Estradiol (most common type in women of child bearing age),  \\nii) Estrone (the only estrogen that the body makes after menopause), and  \\niii) Estriol (the main estrogen during pregnancy).  \\n2) Synthetic Estrogens  \\ni) Steroidal : Ethinylestradiol,  Mestranol, and  Tibolone.  \\nii) Non-Steroidal: Diethylstilbestrol (stilbestrol),  Hexestrol, and  Dienestrol.  \\n \\n8.2.2.2.  Synthesis  \\nEstrogens are mainly produced by the ovaries  in their theca interna cells .

The number of oestrogen receptors in target \\norgans is  decreased by progestins , and th e number  of oestrogen receptors in \\nmammary glands (but not uterus) is increased by prolactin . Estrogens can also \\npromote the synthesis of progesterone receptors in female reproductive organs, \\nhypothalamus, and anterior pituitary.  \\n \\n8.2.2.5.  Pharmacokinetics  \\nEstrogen s are well -absorbed  on oral and transdermal administration ; however  \\nnatural estrogens are inactive when given orally as they rapidly get metabolised \\nin the liver. Estradiol esters injected intramuscularly  are absorbed slowly and \\nprovides long lasting actio n. Natural estrogens in blood circulation are mostly \\nplasma protein bound to SHBG and albumin .  \\n \\nEstradiol in the liver is reversibly converted to estrone , from which estriol is \\nobtained. Estradiol, estrone, and estriol undergo  sulphate and glucuronic acid  \\nconjugation , and the resultant metabolites excrete  through urine and bile. \\nEnterohepatic circulation occurs  because of deconjugation in intestines and \\nreabsorption, eventually excretion occurs through urine.  \\n \\n8.2.2.6.

Drug Interactions  \\nThe effects of estrogens are lowered by rifampin and barbiturates. Estrogens can \\nreduce the  actions of antidiabetic agents, oral anti -coagulants, tricyclic \\nantidepressants , and  anticonvulsants.  They increase the anti -inflammatory or \\nglycosuric effects of hydrocortisone and meperidine. Estrogens also change the \\nresults  of many diagnostic tests.  \\n \\n8.2.2.9.

Estrogen Abnormalities  \\nThe most common cause of low estrogen in females  is either menopause or \\nsurgical removal of ovaries . Low estrogen level causes less frequent or no \\nmenstrual periods,  hot fla shes (suddenly feeling very warm), night sweats,  \\ntrouble in sleeping,  dryness and thinning of vagina,  low sexual desire,  mood \\nswings, and  dry skin.  Due to decrease in estrogen levels, some females  even get \\nmenstrual migraine (a severe  headache before the  menstrual period ). Low \\nestrogen in males  result s in unnecessary belly fat and lessens their sexual desire.  \\n \\nExcess estrogen in females causes weight gain  (especially  in waist, hips, and \\nthighs ), menstrual problems (light or heavy bleeding ), worsening of pre menstrual \\nsyndrome,  fibrocystic breasts (non -cancerous breast lumps),  fibroids (non -\\ncancerous tumours ) in the uterus,  fatigue,  loss of sexual  desire , and  depression or \\nanxiety .

Synthesis  \\nOvary is the main organ  for the production and release of progesterone in \\nmammal s, and results in recurring variations in their circulation levels. Primary \\nfollicles stimulate progesterone  secretion and ovum release during normal cycle. \\nGranulosa cells of the follicle biosynthesise and release estrogen before \\novulation, and after ovulation  they mature and form corpus luteum which \\nstimulates prog esterone and estrogen release in the lat er part of the cycle.   \\n \\n8.2.3.3.  Regulation of Secretion  \\nMany hormones affect progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum. The LH is \\nthe major hormone  whose activity is mediat ed through its intracellular effects on \\ncAMP. Prolactin , FSH, prostaglandins , and β -adrenergic agents are also \\nresponsible for controlling progesterone release.

Pharmacokinetics  \\nProgesterone is orally inactive as it undergoes a  high first -pass metab olism in liver. \\nIt is generally injected intramuscularly in oily solution. Still, it gets quickly cleared \\nfrom plasma and has a short half -life of 5-7 minutes. It undergoes complete \\ndegradation  in liver by sulphate and glucuronic acid conjugation. The majo r \\nmetabolite is pregnanediol, which is excreted through urine. A micronised \\nformulation of progesterone has been manufactured for administering orally. In this \\nformulation, the m icrofine drug particles are suspended in oil and administered in \\ngelatin capsu les. This formulation gets absorbed through  lymphatics , though its \\nbioavailability is low . Almost all synthetic progestins are orally active and are \\nslowly metabolised. They have a plasma half -life of 8-24 hours.  \\n \\n8.2.3.6.  Physiological  Actions  \\nProgesterone has the  following physiological actions  in females:  \\n1) It shows the following actions in the normal female reproductive cycle:  \\ni) It prepares the uterus for pregnancy by shifting the endometrium from \\nproliferation to secretion.  \\nii) Removal of progesterone in the absence of  pregna ncy causes \\nmenstruation (organis ed shedding).  \\niii) It helps in mediating sexual response in the brain.  \\n2) After fertilisation , progesterone has the following actions : \\ni) It maintains the vasculature of the endometrium for implantation.  \\nii) It is responsible for th e enzymatic digestion of zona pellucida for the \\noocyte to implant into the uterine wall.  \\niii) It prevents the contractions of uterine  myometrium  (smooth muscle \\nlayer) and counters the effects of oxytocin on contractility.  \\niv) It promotes lobuloalveolar growth of th e breasts for lactation; however it \\nsuppresses the premature milk protein synthesis before parturition.  \\nv) Certain effects are related to their abili ty of antagonising  estrogen by \\nreducing the expression of estrogen receptors. For example,  the ability \\nof prog esterone to prevent estrogen -mediated endometrial proliferation.  \\nvi) It also has a potent effect as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid \\nreceptor,  decreases  sodium retention when present, and increases sodium \\nretention when progesterone is inhibited.  \\n \\nIn males, the role of progesterone is not clear however it activates sperms when \\nthey reach in the female reproductive tract.

Progesterone Abnormalities  \\nLow progesterone in non-pregnant females  causes  headache , migraine , mood \\nswings , anxiety or depression,  low sex drive,  hot flashes, irregularity in \\nmenstrual cycle , spotting and abdominal pain.  \\n \\nLow progesterone in non -pregnant  females causes  abnormal uterine bleeding. \\nIrregular or no periods suggest poor functioning of ovaries and low progesterone \\nlevels.  \\n \\nHigh levels of p rogesterone  causes  breast tenderness, fatigue, mood swings, \\nbloating, vaginal dryness, sedation, and loss of libido.  \\n \\n8.2.4.  Oral Contraceptives  \\nOral contraceptives are used for preventing pregnancy.

Contraception Methods  \\nThe types of oral contraceptives formulations  are: \\n1) Estrogen -Progestogen Combi nations (Combination Pills): These \\npreparations are given as a  single daily dose from day 5 to day 25 of the \\nmenstrual cycle (21 days), and calculating the first day of menses as day first. \\nOn completion of the course , bleeding occurs within 3 to 4 days sh owing \\nwithdrawal symptoms. There are 7 pill -free days between the regime, and the \\ncourse is restarted on day 5 of the next cycle. The cycle becomes an \\novulatory with regular cycle bleeding on repeating the schedule.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\ni) Estrogen blocks FSH release through negative feedback action on the \\nanterior pituitary, and thus decreases the development of ovarian follicle.  \\nii) Progestogen inhibits LH release and hence stops ovulation. It is also \\nresponsible for making the cervical mucus less appropriate f or the \\npassage of sperm.  \\niii) Estrogen and progestogen work together for altering the endometrium to \\ndepress implantation.  They may also intervene with the synchronised \\ncontractions of cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes which mediate \\nfertilisation and implanta tion. \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nWeight gain  (due to fluid retention or an anabolic effect or both ), mild \\nnausea, flushing, dizzine ss, depression, irritability, s kin changes, ( e.g., acne \\nand/or an increase in pigmentation), and a menorrhea of variable duration on \\nstopping  the pill.  \\n2) Sequential E strogen -Progestogen Preparations (Sequential Pills): These \\nare cyclical estrogen -progestogen preparations,  frequently  recommended for \\nwomen taking combined  HRT, having  menopausal symptoms but normal  \\nperiods . Two types of cyclical HRT are:  \\ni) Monthly  HRT is recommended for women having regular periods.  \\nii) Three -Monthly HRT is recommended for women having irregular periods.  \\n3) Continuous Low -Dosage Progestogen Pr eparations (Minipills): These are \\noral contraceptive s containing progestin hormone only and are also known as \\nthe progestin -only birth control pill s. The minipill s do not have estrogen, \\nbut contain  lower progestin dose than in a combination oral contracept ive \\npill. They act by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus and thinning the \\nuterus lining (endometrium), thus inhibiting the sperm from reaching the egg.  \\n \\nSometimes, the y also suppress  ovulation.

For example , before pregnancy the \\norgan weigh s nearly 50g m, while during the gestation period it weighs up to \\n1000g m. During this duration, its capability may vary from 5ml to 5 litres.  \\n \\nDrugs acting on uterus can influence the endometrium or the myome trium. The most \\nessential drugs influencing the endometrium are estrogens, progestins and their \\nantagonists. Myometrium has both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation and \\nautonomic drugs can disturb its mobility. But, the directly acting drugs are mo re \\nessential and have more specific action s. The sensitivity of myometrium towards \\ndrugs is noticeably affected by the hormonal and gestational status.  \\n \\n8.3.2.  Classification  \\nDrugs acting on uterus are classified as follows:  \\n1) Uterine Stimulants (or Oxytocics or  Abortifacients ): Oxytocin,  Ergot \\nalkaloids ( ergometrine ), and  Prostaglandins . \\n2) Uterine Relaxants (or Tocolytics ): Adrenergic agonists, calcium channel \\nblockers, magnesium sulphate, oxytocin antagonist, and Ritodrine.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 244}),\n",

Oxytocin  \\nSynthetically produced oxyt ocin is pure and is not contaminated with vasopressin \\nlike the out-dated natural oxytocin.

It produces rhythmic \\ncontractions instantaneously, with rela xation between , i.e., it imitates the normal \\nuterine activity.  \\n \\nSevere water intoxication can occur with continuous intravenous  infusions  of \\noxytocin , particularly when given with huge volumes of fluid. The relation of \\noxytocin with neonatal jaundice seems  to be because of increased erythrocyte \\nfragility that causes haemolysis.  \\n \\nChemical Nature  \\nOxytocin is a non-peptide hormone  synthesised by the paraventricular cells of \\nhypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary.

The autonomic innervation of the uterus \\ndoes not facilitate the constr icting effects of the drug. It ha s a direct action on \\nuterus, and shows  more intense effect  on the fundus of uterus than on the cervix. \\nContraction is the form of uterine response  that is followed by relaxation of the \\nuterine smooth muscle s. Durin g the last 9  weeks of pregnancy, the \\nresponsiveness of uterus to oxytocin increases 8 times, and 30 times increase in \\noxytocin receptor density is seen amid early pregnancy and early labour. High \\ndoses of externally administered oxytocin preparations result in sustain ed uterine \\ncontractions which may even rupture the uterus .  \\n \\nPharmacokinetics  \\n1) Absorption:  Intramuscular  administration of oxytocin facilitates  uterine \\ncontractions within  3-5 minutes, and lasts for  2-3 hours. Intravenous  \\nadministration of oxytocin facilita tes uterine contr actions within a minute, \\nand lasts for an  hour. Sometimes oxytocin is given as nasal dosage forms as \\nit gets quickly absorbed through  nasal membranes.  \\n2) Distribution:  Oxytocin gets w idely distributed in the extracellular fluid, and \\nsmall am ounts of it reach  the foetal  circulation.  \\n3) Metabolism:  Oxytocin gets rapidly metabolised by the liver and kidneys.  \\n4) Excretion:  Oxytocin gets e xcreted in urine.  \\n5) Half -Life:  Oxytocin has a half -life of 3-9 minutes.  \\n \\nPhysiological  Actions  \\n1) Uterus:  The m otor activ ity of human uterus is low for the course of first and \\nsecond trimesters of pregnancy . But, spontaneous motor activity increases \\ngradually in the third trimester of pregnancy and lasts up to the beginning of \\nlabour. Oxytocin increases the frequency and for ce of uterine contractions. \\nThe autonomic innervation of the uterus does not facilitate the constricting \\neffects of the drug. It has a direct action on myometrium, and shows more \\nintense effect on the fundus of uterus than on the cervix.  \\n2) Breast:  Induction  of milk ejection is one of the unique actions of oxytocin. \\nMilk ejection is induced by the suckling of breast by the child, and is \\nmediated by the constriction of myoepithelium  surround ing the alveolar \\nchannels in the mammary gland. This action forces  the milk from the \\nalveolar channels into the large collecting ducts, which is accessible by the \\nsuckling child. Oxytocin only induces  milk flow ; it does not increase  the \\namount of milk. After parturition, the synergistic effects of prolactin and \\noxytocin medi ate sufficient milk production and ejection, both of which  are \\nprovoked by the breast suckling by the infant.   \\n3) Heart: Oxytocin causes vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle s. \\nThus, it can cause hypotension and reflex tachycardia.  \\n4) Blood Vessels: Intravenous administration of oxytocin causes  vasodilation and \\ndecrease s blood pressure.

Syntocinon (a synthetic oxytocin ) is used for ind ucing labour, \\nspecifically in uterine inertia.  \\n2) Augmentation of Labour:  Oxytocin can be used in uterine inertia when the \\nnormal first stage of labour is extended with the stoppage of cervical \\ndilatation and descent . \\n3) Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) : Oxytocin is  specifically used for this \\ncondition when effect of ergometrine is insufficient.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\n1) Cardiovascular Effects : Tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, \\nand hypotension in mother and neonate.  \\n2) EENT  (Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat) : Neonatal r etinal haemorrhage.  \\n3) Gastrointestinal Effects : Nausea and vomiting in  mother and neonate.  \\n4) Miscellaneous Effects : Prolonged intravenous  infusion of oxytocin causes  \\nsevere water intoxication with seizures, coma, and even death.  \\n5) Obstetrics and Gynecology : Postpartum haemorrhage in the mother.  \\n \\nInteractions and Contraindications  \\nThe effects of oxytocin are augmented by dinoprostone and misoprostol. \\nOxytocin is contraindicat ed in cases of h ypersensitivities and  expectation  of non -\\nvaginal delivery.  \\n \\nOxytocin Abnor malities  \\nCurrently,  the consequences of large doses of oxytocin are  not clear. High levels  of \\noxytocin may cau se benign prostatic hyperplasia . The affected males may have \\nproblems in passing urine. This condition can be treated  by controlling oxytocin \\nlevels, but  more research is required before any probable treatment is available.    \\n \\nLikewise, presently it is also not completely understood i f low oxytocin levels \\nhave any consequences. The lack of oxytocin  in a nursing mother can stop the \\nmilk ejection ref lex and inhibit breastfeeding.  Low oxytocin levels may cause  \\nautism and autistic spectrum disorders ( e.g., Asperger syndrome ). Some \\nscientists are certain that these disorders can be treated with oxytocin. Low \\noxytocin is also related to depressive symptom s and it has been suggested for \\ntreating depressive disorders.

These receptors on stimulation,  results in constriction of \\nblood vessels and contraction of uterus. These contractions assist in pushing out the \\nplacenta. These actions decrease the blood flow to uterus and assists in decreasing \\nthe blood loss when the placenta separates from the uterus wall.  \\n \\nPhysiological Actions  \\nBoth ergometrine and dihydroergometrine are u sed clinically. The latter has a \\nspecific and quit e stronger effect on the uterus:  \\n1) Uterus: Ergometrine enhances  myometrial contractions, which involves  the \\nfundus, body and cervical segments of the uterus.  The contractions  incline to \\nbe sustained along  with minor relaxation in between contractions.  At high \\ndoses , tonic contractions occur without any interfering relaxation. Uterine \\nblood vessels incline  to get constricted because of muscle contracture. The \\nsensitivity of uterus towards ergometrine is high at term.  \\n2) Blood Vessels: Ergometrine has moderate vasoconstriction activity , and at \\nhigher doses it may cause hypertension.  \\nFigure 8.7: Synthesis of Ergometrine', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 249}),\n",

Injections of ergometrine \\nare used for actively man aging the third stage of labour  that lasts from just after \\nthe delivery of baby till the delivery of placenta. Weak uterine contractions assist \\nin clearing the uterus walls that aids in deli vering the placenta. Ergometrine may \\nbe injected  into the thigh muscles just after the baby is born for inducing  \\ncontractions that accelerate  the delivery of placenta and decrease  the risk of \\naccompanied heavy bleeding.  Ergometrine is given along with oxyt ocin to \\nmanage the third stage of labour and for helping the uterus to contract.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects  \\nErgometrine causes h eadache, dizziness, a bdominal pain, nausea, vomiting , chest \\npain, arrhythmias or bradycardia (irregular or slow heart rate), shortness of \\nbreath, n arrowing of blood vessels in the body extremities (vasoconstriction), \\nincrease in blood pressure, skin rashes, h eart atta ck (very rare), and p alpitation.  \\n \\n8.3.3.3.  Prostaglandins  \\nProstaglandins are not released b y any glands to be transported through blood \\nand act on particular body zones. But, they are produced by a chemical reaction \\nat the required locations in almost all the body organs. Prostaglandins are \\ninvolved in  the process through which the body controls  injury and illness.   \\n \\nEndometrium  and myometrium  have high prostaglandin -synthesising \\ncapability, especially in the second proliferative phase of menstrual cycle.  \\n \\nPGF 2\\uf061 is produced in huge quantities and has been associated to the ischemic \\nnecrosis of e ndometrium that occurs before menstruation. Uterus also produces  \\nvasodilator prostaglandins , such as PGE 2 and PGI 2 (prostacyclin).  \\n \\nApart from their vasoactive properties, the E - and F -prostaglandins also contract \\nthe uterus of both non -pregnant and pregn ant women . During the gestation \\nperiod, the uterine muscles are more sensitive to prostaglandins.  \\n \\nSynthesis  \\nProstaglandins are available in many tissues and organs , and are synthesised by \\nnearly all the nucleated cells. They are autocrine and paracrine li pid mediators , \\nwhich act on platelets, mast cells, and uterine cells. They are synthesised in the \\ncells by Essential Fatty Acids  (EFAs).  \\n \\nAn intermediate arachidonic acid is produced from diacylglycerol by using \\nphospholipase -A2, and  then carried either to  the cyclooxygenase pathway or the \\nlipoxygenase pathway . In the  former  pathway , prostacyclin, thromboxane , and \\nprostaglandin D, E and F are produced; while the latter pathway, which is active \\nin leukocytes and macrophages , produces leukotrienes.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 250}),\n",

Likewise, \\nPGH2 is convert ed to PGI2 by prostacyclin synthase (PGIS). A thromboxane \\nsynthase (TxAS) is also been recognis ed. The reactions producing 9α,11β -PGF2α, β \\nfrom PGD2 and PGF2α from PGH2  are catalysed by the prostaglandin -F synthase \\n(PGFS) in the presence of NADPH. Lately, the PGFS  enzyme has been crystallised \\nin a complex along with PGD2 and bimatoprost ( a synthetic analogue  of PGF2α).  \\n \\nRegulation of Secretion  \\nThe chemical reaction s involved in the production of  prostaglandins. The first \\nstep is catalysed by cyclooxygenase  (cyclooxygenase -1 and cyclooxygenase -2) \\nenzyme . Standard levels of prostaglandins are produced  by the action of \\ncyclooxygenase -1 during normal body functions . During an injury (or \\ninflam mation in any body part), activation of  cyclooxygenase -2 generates extra \\nprostaglandins which assist the body  to respond  to the injury.  \\n \\nProstaglandins act on partic ular receptors  to produce their actions . Nearly , eight types \\nof prostaglandin receptors have been found to be present  in various body organs. \\nThese receptors are responsible for the specific actions of every prostaglandin . \\n \\nProstaglandins are short -lived and are rapidly broken down by the body. They \\nexert their  actions in the closest areas near their production site. This allows in \\ncontrolling and restricting their actions.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action  \\n1) Prostaglandin s mainly act  by enhancing uveoscleral aqueous outf low, \\nhowever other mechanisms like increasing trabecular outflow facility have \\nalso been identified.  \\n2) Their intraocular pressure  depressing effect is greater than others , but at \\ntimes is equivalent to β-blockers.

When an injury occurs in a tissue , the WBCs  reach the site and reduce \\ntissue damage. This results in the synthesis of p rostaglandins.  \\n2) An injury in blood v essel causes blood clotting. Thromboxane (a type of \\nprostaglandin) stimulates platelet contraction and clotting. On the other hand, \\nPGI2 is synthesised for exerting opposite effects on the walls of blood \\nvessels where clots should not be formed.   \\n3) PGE2 ind uces labour a nd other reproductive processes by  stimulating uterine \\ncontractions.  \\n4) Prostaglandins also act on  many other organs like kidneys for surging blood \\nflow, gastrointestinal tract for prevent ing acid synthesis and increasing  \\nprotective mucus secreti on), and leukotrienes for increasing contraction of \\nbronchi related to asthma.  \\n \\nUses  \\nPGE 2 and PFG 2α are strong oxytocics , therefore, they are used for medically \\nterminating pregnancy, for emptying the uterus after missed abortio n, and for \\ntreating benign hyda tidiform mole.

Adrenergic Agonists  \\nPremature labour is suppressed and delivery is delayed during emergency cases or \\nacute foetal distress by using ritodrine  (a β2-selective agonist  having uterine \\nrelaxant action ). For steady action the initial dose is 50µg/min i.v. infusion , which  \\nis increased  after every 10 minutes till uterine contraction stop s or maternal heart \\nrate increases to 120/min.  Contractions are cont inuously suppressed through \\nintravenous  infusion or by 10mg 4 -6 hourly  intramuscular injection followed by  \\n10mg 4 -6 hourly oral administration . Delivery is delayed by few hours to a few \\nweeks  in around 70% cases. Ritodrine results  in increased maternal morbidity. The \\nnew born may develop hypoglycaemia and ileus. Its use should be restricted in \\nmothers having diabetes, h eart disease, or ta king steroids or β -blockers.  \\n \\nIsoxsuprine  is used orally or intramuscularly for stopping susceptible abortions, \\nbut its efficiency is unclear.  \\n \\nMechanism of Action: Ritodrine is a β 2-receptor agonist which acts on the \\nsmooth muscle cell s and increase cAMP levels in the presence of adenylate \\ncyclase enzyme. The increased levels of cAMP reduce the concentration of free \\ncalcium ions and also contractions.  \\n \\nAdverse Effects:  Hypotension , arrhythmia, pulmonary oedema, tachycardia, hyper -\\ninsulinaemia, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, anxiety, headache, and restlessness.  \\n \\n8.3.4.2.  Calcium Channel Blockers  \\nCalcium channel blockers  decrease the tone of myometrium and prevent \\ncontractions because the entry o f Ca2+ ions is important for uterine contractions. \\nIf used early, nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) delays labour effectively  as \\nit has a  smooth muscle relaxant action. 10mg nifedipine after every 20-30 \\nminutes is used orally until uterine contraction s diminish , and 10mg nifedipine 6 \\nhourly is given  afterwards. Tachycardia and hypotension occur  at doses \\nsuppressing uterine contractions.  Decreased placental perfusion causes foetal \\nhypoxia.

Introduction  \\nBioassay  (or biological assay  or biologic standardisation ) is the method of \\nestimating  the potency  of an active principle in a unit amount of formulation or \\ndetection and measurement of a substance’s concentr ation in a formulation using \\nbiological methods (i.e., observation of clinical effects on living tissue s, \\nmicro/macro or immune cells or animal).  Bioassays are procedures for estimating \\nthe nature, constitution, or potency of substance s through the reactio ns that \\naccompany its use in living matter.  \\n \\nBioassay is the method of determining the concentration  or potency  of physical, \\nchemical, or biological agents through measurement  of and comparison between \\nthe extents  of response of test with the standard in an appropriate biological \\nsystem kept under a standard set of parameters. Bioassays  also involve estimating \\nthe potency  of materials through observation of  their pharmacological effects on \\nliving animals ( in vivo ) or isolated tissues ( in vitro ) and compari son of the  effects \\nof materials of unknown potency with those of  standard .  \\n \\n9.1.2.  Principles  \\nBurn and Dale articulated certain principles for conducting biological assays . \\nThese principles should  be followed to derive effective res ults. \\n \\nPrinciple 1  \\nAll bioassays (toxicity studies, laboratory studies, and clinical trials) should be \\nrelative against a standard drug or formulation. In this  way, error s due to \\nbiological variation in bioassays  can be reduced , as the new sample is \\nconcur rently compared with standard formulations.  \\n \\nStandard Preparations (Reference Standards):  A standard preparation is a \\nrepresentative of the substance based on which the activity is comparatively \\nmeasured . The se standard preparations are delivered to expert s, pharmaceutical \\nindustries , and research laboratories for standardising new batches of productions.  \\n \\nThese reference standards are upheld and distributed within India by the Central \\nDrug Research Laboratory , Calcutta, and the Central Research Institute, Kasauli. \\nThey are controlled by  U.S Pharmacopoeial  Authorities in U.S.A , and by the \\nNational Institute of Medical Research, London , in Great Britain . They are also \\nmaintained and distributed to different  laboratories by the Expert Committee on \\nBiolog ical S tandardisation made by the WHO.

But, this statement will stand \\ninvalid if the curves are not parallel.  \\n \\nPrincip le 3 \\nThe procedure for comparing the unknown with the standard drug should ideally \\n(not essentially) test the therapeutic properties of the drug. In an ideal si tuation, an \\nanalgesic should be checked for its analgesic activity, and an anticonvulsant should \\nbe checked for its antico nvulsant activity. But, it is not always achievable, e.g., for \\ninsulin dropping of blood glucose would be the preferable potency index, but the \\nfrequently used method is mouse convulsion method, where the per centage of \\nmouse developing convulsions is match ed with the standard and new insulin.  \\n \\nPrincip le 4 \\nThe procedure should assess and allow an approximation of the errors because of \\nbiological diversification in various animals/persons at any given time and in the \\nsame animal/person at different times. The measures undertaken for minimising \\nerrors due to biological variations include:  \\n1) The experimental conditions should be kept constant.  \\n2) The biological response (indicator) s hould be sensitive to the drug.  \\n3) The biological response ( indicator ) should  be insensi tive to other drugs.  \\n4) The biological response ( indicator ) should give constant a nd reproducible results.  \\n5) A standard preparation formulation (of known concentration ) should be \\navail able for comparing the response.  \\n6) Large number of  experiments and assays shoul d be conducted  for minimising \\nbiological variation,  and  \\n7) Animals of the same species and st rain (ideally litter mates) , of equal age, \\nweight and gender, consuming equivalent diet and sheltered in same \\nconditions  should be used for performing experiments . In some bioassay \\ndesigns , cross -over of animals getting the sample and standard may occur.  \\n \\nBriefly, the  sources of error in bioassays are primarily of two types:  \\n1) Errors due to biological variation, and  \\n2) Errors due to faulty methodology.      \\n \\n9.1.3.  Applications  \\nFollowing are the applications of bioassay methods:  \\n1) They are used for the s tandardisat ion of drugs of natural origin . \\n2) They are used for determining the  biologically active substances (such as \\nnoradrenaline, adrenaline, acetylc holine, and serotonin ) in body fluids or \\ntissue extracts .     \\n3) They are used for the s election of new compounds for determining their \\nbiological activity.

It is an economic and considerable approach for determining the \\navailability of several endogenous compounds of pharmacological, physiological, \\nand toxicological importance , like hypothalamic factors, serotonin, encephalins, \\nEDRF, and prostaglandins.  \\n \\n9.1.4.  Types of Bioas say \\nThere are three major types of bioassays (apart from qualitative assays):  \\n1) Indirect Assay: In this bioassay type , the relationship of dose with the  \\nresponse of each drug is firstly determined. Then the dose conforming to a \\nparticular response is derived from the relation for each drug individually.  \\n2) Direct Assay: In this bioassay type, the d oses of standard and test \\npreparations are satisfactory  for generating a particular response and can be \\ndetermined  directly.  \\n3) Quantal Assay: In this bioassay type, the response occurs as “all or none” \\nmeaning no response or extreme response. End point method is used for their \\nbioassay. Threshold effect produces a predetermined response that is measured.  \\n \\nStandardofion ConcentratTesttheof DoseStandardtheof Dose=  Unknown ofion Concentrat \\uf0b4\\n \\n \\nVarious other type s of bioassays are as follows:  \\n1) Graded Assay: It is proportionate to the  drug dose and the drug response  range s \\nfrom no response to extreme response. Graded response can be any type of \\nmeasured response s in isolated tissues (mostly) and also in whole animal s. These \\nresponses are extensively graded and are available in abundance . For example , \\nblood pressure, blood sugar concentrations, contractions of muscle , etc.', metadata={'source': 'ex.pdf', 'page': 259}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='260 Pharmacology  \\n*  * 2) Matching Method: This bioassay procedure involves the test substance and \\nstandard substance, a nd responses produced are compared wit h a trial and \\nerror procedure till they generate equivalent effects.  \\n \\nThis may also be restricted to analytical dilution assay  because the assay \\nincludes the measurement of the factor by which the test substance is dil uted or \\nconcentrated for producing a response which is equivalent to that of a known \\nquantity  of the standard drug. The benefit  of this method is its non -dependency \\non the assumption of a dose -response relationship. The major shortcomings  of \\nthis method are that it is completely theoretical and experimental errors cannot \\nbe determined . Qualitative differences occurs because it does not provide any \\nsign or similarity in the dose -response curves of the standard drug and test \\nsubstance , and the effects are com pared only at the dose level .  \\n \\nAdvantages   \\nIt is a fast, easy, and useful method when there are multiple samples for \\ntesting and a semi -qualitative answer is adequate.  \\n \\nDisadvantages  \\nThis method does not provide  accuracy , and drug -response data  (especiall y \\nno data related to slope ). The data is not statistically analysed and may not be \\ncompletely analysed.  \\n3) Bracketing Method: This bioassay is carried out through selection of two \\nstandard doses , which would provide a close bracket on both sides of the \\nrespon se produced by the unknown . The working dose of the standard is \\nfirstly calculated in the sensitive part of the dose -response curve, i.e.,  a dose \\nthat will  produce almost 50% of the maximum concentration. The standard \\ndrug dose is maintained throughout the  experiment for getting an indication \\nabout the change in the responsiveness of tissue with time.  \\n \\nThe standard drug is added at fixed intervals , but discontinuous with the test \\nso that every response generated by a dose of test substance is bracketed by \\nresponses produced by the standard dose. The response of test substance is \\nbracketed in the middle of two responses of the standard. More precise \\nresults are obtained through close bracketing.  \\n4) Interpolation Method: This bioassay is the easiest graded respon se method, \\nand does not need any statistical data or many calculations. Firstly, the drug -\\nresponse curve is obtained from varying doses of standard ACh solution , and \\nthen concentration of unknown is read from the standard graph.   \\n \\nInterpolation bioassay me thod takes less time and is still impeccable in \\ncontrast to matching type of bioassay. One of the main benefits  of this assay \\nis that the responsiveness of tissue is first determined by the previous plotting \\nof a dose -response curve with a known agonist li ke in the case of \\nacetyl choline. If a curve has good linearity, then very precise estimation of \\nthe test substance can be done.  \\n5) Three Point Bioassay: In this bioassay  method , the Drug -Response Curve \\n(DRC) of a standard and test samples is obtained  from the  responses because \\nof graded doses.

The responses of \\nthese dose s are shown by the sharpest and the linear part  of the curve. One \\ntest from the DRC of test sample is selected in a way that it provides a \\nresponse between the two standard responses, i.e., greater response than S1 \\nand a smaller response than S2 and is designated as T.  \\n \\nPrior to the bioassay, the stand ard and test doses are selected  by recording \\nthe standard and test responses in a randomised manner as per Latin square \\ndesign. The addition pattern of doses is S1, S2, T; S2, T, S1, and T, S1, S2 in \\n3 sequential cycles. The average values of height of contraction for all 3 \\ndoses are calculated and are brought in use for plotting graph to evaluate the \\ntest sample  potency . The accuracy and consistency of three point bioassay  \\nmethod is better than that of matching and bracketin g methods, and the \\nresponsiveness of the isolated tissue formulation is evaluated before testing \\nthe unknown sample.  \\n \\nAdvantages  \\nIt is a quick method  and more accurate than the matching bioassay. Certain \\nstatistical methods can be used, but not with much reliability.  \\n \\nDisadvantages  \\nThis method does not provide accuracy and  inherent ly locks precision . \\n6) Four Point Bioassay: This typical 2×2  parallel bioassay method is sufficient \\nfor measuring parallelism in which drugs acting by the same mechanism are \\nanticip ated to create parallel DRCs.  \\n7) Seed Bioassay: Seeds are living organisms , which can be damaged by using \\nchemicals. The seed bioassay method  is meant as significant and lab scale \\nmethod for evaluating the toxicity of any substance on commercial crops.  \\n \\nThe seed germination and seed growth imprints under the conflicting \\nconcentrations of industrial origin may give an idea about the eradicating or \\ntoxicological impact of industrial emissions on plants. A lab -scale bioassay \\nof distillery emissions was done usi ng some commercially used cereal crops \\nto derive a possible use of distillery emissions in crop irrigation.  \\n8) Antimicrobial Assay: For this bioassay method , standard and clinically \\nderived microorganism strains are used. Many human, animal , and plant \\ndisease s are caused by  pathogenic microorganisms . Fungal and bacterial \\ninfections are the main cause of death in higher organisms. Therefore, the \\ndiscovery of penicillin is thought to be one of the best inventions of the world. \\nThe microbial assay for antibiotics  is a procedure that involves microorganisms \\nfor determining the antimicrobial potency of the antibiotics present in medicine.  \\n \\nTraditionally, most of the new antibiotics were isolated from natural sources \\nsuch as soil microbes and plants. Many others were synthesised later  to be \\nused clinically . Unluckily, human tussle against pathogenic microbes will \\nstill need more time to be solve d because of several reasons.

Therefore, the discovery and \\ndevelopment of new antimicrobial agents  is still under process. Significant \\nvariety of chemicals available in biological samples has  a huge potential in \\ndiscovering new antimicrobial agents.  \\n9) Antifungal Assay: Fungal infections have increased largely  during the last \\ndecade and these generally occur as systemic infections or as co -infections \\nwith other diseases like AIDS or cancer, or in immune -compromised \\npatients. There is a significant requir ement for discovering new fungi -toxic \\ncompounds, as there are numerous  plant and human fungal diseases; for \\nexample , hop downy mildew, potato late blight, tobacco blue mould, dutch \\nelm disease, cereal rusts, corn blight, ergot of rye, and grape downy milde w \\nare some of the plant fungal diseases ; while  Aspergillosis, Histoplasmosis, \\nathlete’s foot, and co ccidiomycosis  are some of the human fungal diseases . \\nThe increase in fungal infections and the  increasing amount o f new \\nantifungal agents suggest  a growing demand  for quick and precise methods \\nfor selecting antifungal agents and susceptibility testing .  \\n10) Antimitotic Assay:  Any applied stimulus that generates a reliable \\nchange/deviation in the mitotic cycle is known as an antimitotic agent. \\nPrevention of cell d ivision is the extent of antimitotic activity of chemical \\ncompounds.  Antimitotic chemical compounds like podophyllotoxin and \\nvinblastine can prevent cell division of fertilised sea urchin eggs and starfish \\noocytes.

The e xperiment is performed after a week. The  rabbits  are \\nfasted and the initial blood sugar level is estimated. The grouping is reversed, i.e., \\nthe animals which received the standard are given the test and those which got \\nless dose of the standard are adminis tered with the higher dose of the test and \\nvice versa . The average percentage reduction in blood sugar of the first and \\nsecond part of the test is determined.  \\n \\nMouse Method  \\nDistinctive convulsions are shown by the mice after  subcutaneous  injection s of \\ninsulin at increased temperatures.

Firstly, the drug -\\nresponse curve is obtained from varying doses of standard ACh solution, and \\nthen concentration of unknown is read from the standard graph.  \\n5) Bioassay methods are used for the standar disation of drugs of natural \\norigin . \\n6) Bioassay methods are used for the selection of new compounds  for \\ndetermining their biological activity.  \\n7) There are three major types of bioassays  (apart from qualitative assays).  \\n8) Standard insulin  is pure, dry, and crysta lline. As stated by the Ministry of \\nHealth, Government of India, one unit consists of 0.04032mg of insulin, \\nwhich is equal to international unit.  \\n9) The vasopressor activity of arginine vasopressin  is determined by \\ncomparing the activity of its test preparati on with that of its standard \\npreparation under the conditions of an appropriate method of assay.  \\n10) Bioassay of ACTH  is an old assay method. Upon administration, ACTH \\ndecreases the ascorbic acid available in adrenals. This association is used for \\nthe quantit ative assay of ACTH.  \\n11) Dehydrated alcohol  is used for extracting a particular amount of digitalis  \\npowder in a continuous extraction apparatus for 6 hours.

Electrophysiology of Heart  \\nThe cardiac cell is a polarised membrane . It has a  resting membrane potential of \\n–80 to –90mV , and a high Na+ ion concentration outside the membrane and K+ \\nion concentration inside the membrane.

Under Napoleon III, who had been impressed by London’s parks while living in Britain, two ancient royal military preserves at the approaches to Paris were made into “English” parks—the Bois de Boulogne to the west and the Bois de Vincennes to the east. At its centre is the Île de la Cité, which is the seat of religious and temporal authority (the word cité connotes the nucleus of the ancient city).

For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7]\\nThe City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants on January 1, 2023, or about 19% of the population of France,[2] making the region France's primate city. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[9]\\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport.[10][11] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[12] it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[13] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 7.8 million visitors in 2022, keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[14] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105\\xa0km2 (41\\xa0sq\\xa0mi),[5] Paris is the fifth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6]\"},\n",

Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\\nImmediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. After seizing power in Paris on 28\\xa0March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\\n20th and 21st centuries[edit]\\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\\nEconomy[edit]\\nThe economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[182] The Paris region\\'s most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris\\'s economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.[194] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[194]\\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195]'}]"
